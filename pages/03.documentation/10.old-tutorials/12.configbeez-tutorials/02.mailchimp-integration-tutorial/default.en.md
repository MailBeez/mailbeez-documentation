## About This Tutorial

The MailChimp Integration tutorial picks up where the installation instructions leave off, by taking you step-by-step through all aspects of getting your module up and running.

This tutorial will guide you through getting started with MailChimp as well as configuring your module using the handy built-in configuration wizard, testing the module, and then taking the module live so it can begin working for you.

## Getting Started

Before you jump in to configuring your newly installed MailChimp Integration module, there are a couple of tasks you must complete first:

- If you don’t already have a MailChimp account, you will need to [create one](http://www.mailchimp.com)
- Create new mailing lists in MailChimp for testing purposes

Now, which test lists you’ll need to create in MailChimp will depend upon how you plan to manage your mailing lists. There are 3 options, each of which corresponds to an Integration Mode configuration option in the module (more on that later). Begin by deciding which option will work best for you.


### Setting Up Test Lists in MailChimp

**Option A**  
 If you will be using Option A, log in to your account at MailChimp and create a list called “MailBeez Test Masterlist”. Do not add any subscribers to the list.

**Option B**  
 If you will be using Option B, log in to your account at MailChimp and create a list called “MailBeez Test Masterlist” and add 5 -10 email addresses that you have access to.

Please make sure that some of the email addresses are tied to valid customer accounts in your store, otherwise there will be no subscribers in the “MailBeez Test Worklist”.

Now, create a second list called “MailBeez Test Worklist”. Do not add any subscribers to the list.

**Option C**  
 If you will be using Option C, log in to your account at MailChimp and create a list called “MailBeez Test Worklist”. Do not add any subscribers to the list.

## Next Steps

Now that you’ve got your MailChimp account and test lists all set up over at MailChimp, it’s time to configure and test the MailChimp integration module!
