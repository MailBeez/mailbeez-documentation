## About This Widget

**Tip:** You must have a Google Analytics account set up and have it activated & configured in MailBeez for this widget to function.

Delivered with the MailBeez v2.6+ framework, the Google-Analytics-O-Pie is a powerful widget that provides you with a visual report in the form of a pie chart of all the MailBeez activity data that Google Analytics tracks for you, such as site visits resulting from MailBeez email campaigns, revenue earned with MailBeez, and a breakdown of that revenue by module so that you can see which modules are working hardest for you!

## Common Questions

### Why does the Google Analytics data differ from MailBeez Analytics data?

Google Analytics can only track orders made after clicking a direct link in a MailBeez generated email, so for example, if a customer receives a MailBeez coupon email on his mobile device, but then later places his order using his desktop computer by simply typing in the discount code from the email, the Google Analytics connection to the MailBeez Email is lost.

Conversely, any orders made using MailBeez generated coupons will be tracked by MailBeez Analytics whether the customer clicks the link in the email or manually enters the coupon code from the email during checkout.

### Why do I have such few clicks recorded in Google Analytics?

Some stores do not have Google Analytics tracking on their store-front. When your MailBeez emails contain a link to the store-front, these visits, (and the resulting purchases), won’t be recorded by Google Analytics.
