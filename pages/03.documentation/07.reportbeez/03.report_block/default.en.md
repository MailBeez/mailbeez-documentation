## The Opt-Out Data Report

Delivered with the MailBeez framework software, this report provides a list of customers who opted out of receiving emails through the opt-out link embedded in the emails generated by MailBeez.

The list is broken down by module, which allows you to see which customers opted out of which types of email.

The report will even tell you which mode you were in when the opt-out occurred:

- PROD - Opt-out occurred in Production Mode
- [SIM] – Opt-out occurred in Simulation Mode

**Note:** Opt-out tracking & reporting only works in simulation mode when configured properly. Please go to **Configuration tab > Simulation > ”Edit” > Enable Tracking in Simulation Mode** and set it to “True”.

To delete the opt-out data collected while in simulation mode, click the Simulation “Restart” button.
