In this configuration module you can adopt the visual editor to your needs.


**Root for image browser**

You can configure a root directory for the image browser relative to your store-root. If you have a large number of images in yourr store the image browser can become very slow. In this case it would make sense to configure a dedicated root directory for the image browser.


**Mobile Editor View Width**

Please only change these settings if you fully understand the impact. Very important: The email template must support the configured width settings.
