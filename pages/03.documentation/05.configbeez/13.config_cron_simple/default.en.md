## About This Module

Requires MailBeez V2.2+

With this simple Mailbeez add-on, you can do away with the need to configure a cronjob to activate your Mailbeez installed modules. Instead, the plugin cleverly utilizes your store’s traffic to trigger Mailbeez as often as you have configured it to run. For site owners looking to get up and running quickly, or who do not wish to enter the server environment to setup a Cronjob, this is a very handy feature.

## Lightweight and fast

Thanks to time stamp based caching technology, the additional load added to your store’s pages by the add-on is extremely small. In fact, with the aid of modern AJAX technology, visitors to your store will not feel or notice any difference, as the add-on only triggers MailBeez after a page has loaded completely.

## Set It & Forget It

Installation and configuration are fast and easy! Installation instructions are included in the download package. [Run MailBeez Automatically Configuration Tutorial](http://www.mailbeez.com/documentation/tutorials/configbeez-tutorials/run-mailbeez-automatically-configuration-tutorial/)
