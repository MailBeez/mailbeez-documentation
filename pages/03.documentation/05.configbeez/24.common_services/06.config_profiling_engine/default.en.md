Under development - The MailBeez profiling engine allows you to add rule-based tags to customer profiles and orders. 

These tags can be utilized by other control-modules to control the behaviour and content of email modules, creating rich relationships between content and customer segments. This allows for even more effective targeting of your email campaigns.


Examples

- Tag all customers, who've never purchased product B, with tag "upsell-B"
- Tag all customers, who've only purchased from category X, with tag "only-cat-X"
- Tag all orders containing product H with tag "product-H"



Modules utilizing tags are:

- [Profile Filter](/documentation/filterbeez/filter_check_profile)  
 Examples
      - only send Birthday coupons to customers tagged with "upsell-B"
      - never send a product review reminder to customer orders containing "product H"
    

- [Profile Content](/documentation/filterbeez/filter_add_profiling_content)  
 Examples
      - insert upsell content promoting product B in all emails for customers tagged with "upsell-B"



- [Profile Information](/documentation/filterbeez/filter_add_profiling)  
 Examples
      - build custom logic code using order characteristics and/or parameters found in the customer profile.
