This popular module is developed by [www.web4design.de](http://www.web4design.de/) in close cooperation with MailBeez.

Plays well together with [Shopvoting Invitation Advanced](/documentation/mailbeez/shoprating_advanced/) module with auto-login, frequent-buyer recognition and more pro features
 
 
### Installation

This module is already part of the MailBeez System. You only need to insert the code-snippet for displaying the badge into your store-front. Please [Go to integration manual](http://www.web4design.de/module_infos/english/shopreviews/index.php) for more information.
 

## customers reviews - self hosted

This add-on allows your customer to vote your stores and give a review.

With a nicely designed widget you can display the reviews in your shopping cart.

The design and layout is comparable to hosted solutions, but you have full control on your ratings - and all for free.

The module hooks into the [BeezDesk CRM Customer Insight](/documentation/configbeez/config_customer_insight/) so you will the notifications for new shopvotings. Also you are able to see shop voting for the customer you currently work on.

## More Information

### Looks great and improves conversion

<div style="float:right" markdown="1">![](shoprating_box.en.png)</div>

The new MailBeez Shopvoting Module allows your customers to rate your store and service. Hosted on your own server with complete control.

**Store-Ratings are known to increase conversion and for this good reason there are many online services for hosted Store-Ratings.**

However not everyone likes the idea of not having control on the ratings, sharing customer data and getting locked into a monthly fee. That’s why we teamed up with **[www.web4design.de](http://www.web4design.de/)**, who has developed a beautiful and great working for self-hosted store ratings already helping 1000's of online stores to increase conversion.
 
**Store ratings or product reviews? Both!**   
Store ratings and [product reviews](/documentation/mailbeez/review_advanced/) are complementary, so you can use them both in your store.

We recommend to ask your customers for a store rating short after delivery and e.g. 30 days later for a review of their purchased products. **Two natural points of contact** which improve your **customer interaction** and **brand recognition** - and will increase your revenue!


### Professional Rating-Page included

Clicking on the badge opens a professional designed page showing details about the ratings and allowing customers to place a new rating as well (better invite them using MailBeez ;) ).

### Get serious - go advanced

While the free module already works great, professional stores will go for the MailBeez Premium add-on "[Shopvoting Invitation Advanced](/documentation/mailbeez/shoprating_advanced/)" which provides a range of advanced features like **auto-login** and **recognition of regular customers** which will generate up to twice as many ratings. And you can even **integrate real-time ratings in any MailBeez-generated Email** by placing a simple template tag in MailBeez Emails

 [go to Shopvoting Invitation Advanced](/documentation/mailbeez/shoprating_advanced/)

### Integrated into free BeezDesk CRM Customer Insight

![](Screen_shoprating_beezdesk.en.png)


Just integrate the free [BeezDesk CRM Customer Insight](/documentation/configbeez/config_customer_insight/)  into your Store Admin panel by adding a single code-line and you will get **notified about new customer ratings**, see the current rating summary and have **direct access to the configuration panel** of the MailBeez Shopvoting Module!
