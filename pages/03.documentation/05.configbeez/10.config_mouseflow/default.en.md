## What is Mouseflow?

[Mouseflow](http://localhost/wordpress_mailbeez_EOL/wp-content/plugins/adrotate/adrotate-out.php?track=OSwwLDAsaHR0cDovL3d3dy5zaGFyZWFzYWxlLmNvbS9yLmNmbT9iPTIyOTA5NiZhbXA7dT00NTAwNjEmYW1wO209MjcxODImYW1wO3VybGxpbms9JmFtcDthZmZ0cmFjaz0) is a web service that gathers data & presents it as heat maps, telling you which areas of your site are getting the most attention by your visitors. Areas being overlooked by users can then be improved to gain more attention.

  
 The MailBeez Mouseflow Integration module works with your existing Mouseflow installation to allow you to track visitors arriving to your site from links within all of your MailBeez generated emails.

Visit [Mouseflow](http://localhost/wordpress_mailbeez_EOL/wp-content/plugins/adrotate/adrotate-out.php?track=OSwwLDAsaHR0cDovL3d3dy5zaGFyZWFzYWxlLmNvbS9yLmNmbT9iPTIyOTA5NiZhbXA7dT00NTAwNjEmYW1wO209MjcxODImYW1wO3VybGxpbms9JmFtcDthZmZ0cmFjaz0) to register and get **100 monthly recordings free**.

## MailBeez and Mouseflow – A Powerful Combination

Insert 1 line of PHP code to get the Mouseflow Integration module to do everything for you that Mouseflow does!

Additionally, integrating MailBeez with Mouseflow lets you control what kind of users you would like to record so you can keep your costs down:

- Activate/De-activate the module as desired
- Include or exclude visitors coming through MailBeez Email campaigns
- Limit recordings to only those visitors coming through MailBeez Email campaigns
- Exclude Administrators by IP so you don’t pay for recordings from visits by you or your employees

Keeping costs low doesn’t mean having to sacrifice getting the data you need! With the MailBeez Mouseflow Integration module, get answers to such questions as:

- Which steps do customers perform when asked to write a review? Is your review process easy & friendly?
- How to customers react to Winback campaigns? Do you need to change the verbiage in my Winback emails?
- How do coupons influence your customers behavior? Do your coupons need tweaking?
- Are you seeing a sales result from the Birthday Greeting module, or do you need to upgrade to the Birthday Coupon module?

With the MailBeez Mouseflow Integration module, you can improve your MailBeez Email campaigns, optimize your landing pages to your visitor’s behavior, and identify new & better ways to make MailBeez work for you!
