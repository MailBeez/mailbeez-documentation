## Display Product Images in Your Emails

The List Engine is responsible for generating the product image grid which is displayed in the emails generated by some of the premium email modules.

You can configure the List Engine settings to control the number of columns in product image grid and the number of product images displayed. If you need assistance with the configuration settings, you can visit the [configuration tutorial](/documentation/tutorials/ "Configuration Tutorials") for any module that utilizes the List Engine.
