## About This Module

The Multilanguage Extension provides compatible online stores with the tools to make a hassle free, fast and easy entry into the world of internationalization, by enabling all existing and future MailBeez Modules (even your own as long as they use MailBeez template system), to support multiple language input.

With that taken care of, all that is left for you to do is to translate your email text into the additional languages, (and with tools like mygengo, this could not be easier), copy it into the module’s admin, and away you go.

## Become a Global Seller With MailBeez

**Your first step to saying こんにちは (hello!)**

The main difference between traditional and online stores is without doubt the potential to attract international customers. Whether you sell guitars, high heels or even garden furniture, if you are online, you can sell to the world.

Of course, one of the challenges in selling internationally is the ability to communicate with your customers, and so whereas English might be the dominant language of commerce in your territory, that doesn’t mean your foreign customers want to receive email communication in that same language.

Because none of the supported shopping systems actually store information about the customer’s language, the MailBeez Multilanguage Extension uses a few different techniques to analyze the existing data for reconstruction of the customer’s language.

With the Multilanguage Extension, you now have the tools to communicate with your customers in their native tongue, and easily edit your Mailbeez module content, right from within your store’s admin!

## Top Features

- Automatic detection of configured languages
- Configuration of automatic multilevel customer language detection based on historic data and address data
- Support for customized customer language fields
- Plugin-design for customer language detection e.g. based own modifications to store the customer’s language
- Automatic import of modules .tpl files
- In-admin editing of Mailbeez module content
- Ability to restore the default template for total backwards compatibility
- Easier upgrade of MailBeez since the templates are moved into the database

## Additional Features

An intuitive Template Editor with embedded buttons for previewing both the html & txt versions of the email and sending test email:

The default buttons (outside the editor environment) for “View html”, “View txt” and “Send Test-Mail” are automatically enhanced with a dialog for selecting the language:

Whilst running your Mailbeez email modules, this module enhances the output list with information about the detected language and the language detection method:
