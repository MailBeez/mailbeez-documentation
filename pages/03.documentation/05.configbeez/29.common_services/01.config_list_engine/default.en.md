##Display Product Images in Your Emails

The List Engine is responsible for generating the product image grid which is displayed in the emails generated by some of the premium email modules.

You can configure the List Engine settings to control the **number of columns in product image grid** and the **number of product images** displayed. 

**Note**: the product list subtemplate must support these configuration settings.
