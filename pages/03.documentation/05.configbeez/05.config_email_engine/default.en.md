### Error Sending Emails <a id="error"></a>

In case the SMTP server throws an error when trying to send an email, this email will be marked with `message_id=-1`. 

The system status overview will tell you, how many errors have occurred.

With click on the tool symbol, you can choose between following actions to resolve the situation:


####Restart
The faulty entries will be deleted from your system. Depending on the timing and module configuration the system will try to send them again.

####Ignore
The faulty entries will be marked, and the system will not try to send them again.

>>>>>>Please check the configuration of your SMTP server in case you get many errors. Some SMTP-Server might be configured to send only emails with a specific sender domain. So for a different sender-domain the SMTP-Server will quit with an error.
