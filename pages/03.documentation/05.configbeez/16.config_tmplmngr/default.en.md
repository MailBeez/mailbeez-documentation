The visual Template Manager with support for responsive Emails allows you to easily edit and view your text changes right from the MailBeez area within your store’s admin! 

It is fully functional with all official (free and premium) MailBeez Modules as well as with custom built modules, making template editing a breeze – so much so that you may wonder how you ever lived without it!

Say goodbye to downloading template files, editing & saving them on your local drive, uploading them back to your server, and viewing them online only to have to go back and repeat the process after every change.  

## Features

- **Comfortable Visual editor** makes no html knowledge necessary
- **Preview in mobile devices** with different screen sizes like iPhone, iPad
- Edit your email copy in **real time**, then preview and send test emails
- **save user templates** so you can role back if necessary
- **Restoration of the default template** in case anything goes wrong
- **Upwards compatible** with the Mailbeez [Multilanguage Template Manager](/documentation/configbeez/config_tmplmngr_lng/ "Multilanguage Template Manager") so you can take your store multilingual!
- **Nerd-Mode** with syntax highlighting allows you to edit source code  for greates flexibility
- **Easier upgrade of MailBeez** as the templates are moved into the store’s database
- **Automatic import** of module .tpl files

The editor provides embedded buttons for previewing the html & txt versions of the email, as well as allowing you to directly send a test email; all of which makes fast editing very easy:  
  
  
>>>>>By default the system automatically generates a TXT version from the HTML templates. If you want to customize the txt version for a module you also need to create a custom txt version for the main template.
