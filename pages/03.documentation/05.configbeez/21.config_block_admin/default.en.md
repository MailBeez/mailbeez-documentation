## About This Module

This module enhances the default Opt-Out handling which is already built into MailBeez by allowing you to adjust customer Opt-Out settings by manually editing which of your customers will receive Mailbeez generated emails. And it can all be done from within your store’s admin! With this module, you can:

- Insert “block all” links into your email templates, allowing customers to choose between blocking specific emails and blocking all MailBeez generated emails
- Manually unblock customers who opt-out via accidental click
- Disable opt-out for selected modules – for example, payment reminder emails
- Manually block and unblock a customer on a per module basis
- Manually block and unblock a customer on a global basis



## New in Version 2.8: Bulk processing

Are you having email-addresses to block from external systems? This new feature allows you to easily block the matching customers.

- Pasted Email-Addresses you want to block into the input field – one address per line
- Select the modules to block
- the Email-Addresses are processed against your customer-table and the matching customers are blocked

Installation and configuration are fast and easy! Installation instructions are included in the download package.
