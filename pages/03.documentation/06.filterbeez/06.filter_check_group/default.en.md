## About This Filter

**Please Note: This module is Zen Cart, CRE Loaded B2B, xt:Commerce, xtc-Modified and Gambio GX compliant only.**

If you sell to different customer groups, then the Customer Group Filter is for you! This handy module gives you total email control by allowing you to choose which customer groups will receive your various Mailbeez campaigns.

Since different market sectors will almost certainly have individual marketing needs, splitting customers into groups is a great idea!

For example, you probably don’t want a wholesale customer to receive a product review request, or an end user customer to receive a product offer at the wholesale price.

The Mailbeez Group Filter module gives you the ability to choose which group is authorized to receive a campaign.

Installation and configuration are fast and easy! Installation instructions are included in the download package.
