## Add a “Block All” Link to Your Emails

Delivered with the [Advanced Opt-Out with Admin](http://www.mailbeez.com/documentation/configbeez/config_block_admin/) module, this filter lets you add a “Block All” link to all of your MailBeez generated emails.

By default, all MailBeez generated emails provide an opt-out link for customers, which you can configure to function as an opt-out link for the module that generated it, or as an opt-out of all emails link regardless of which module generated it. This configuration setting is in the Spam Compliance section of the Configuration tab of your MailBeez interface. [Visit the Configuration Tutorial](http://www.mailbeez.com/documentation/tutorials/mailbeez-comprehensive-configuration-tutorial/)

But when you install the [Advanced Opt-Out with Admin](http://www.mailbeez.com/documentation/configbeez/config_block_admin/) module, you have a greater flexibility because this filter will let you add a “Block All” link to your emails in addition to the default opt-out link which you can configure to work on a per-module basis.

This flexibility results in your MailBeez generated emails offering customers two opt-out links: one to opt-out of emails generated by the module that generated it, and another to opt out of all MailBeez generated emails.

Providing this level of choice to your customers can decrease your overall opt-out rate – very cool!
