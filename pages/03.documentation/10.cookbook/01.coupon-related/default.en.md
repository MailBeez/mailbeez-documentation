## Voucher as a gift product

### Requirement
You want to give your customers the option to purchase a store voucher that they can use as a gift.


### Solution
Using the [Newsletter Advanced Module](/documentation/mailbeez/newsletter) you can customize and automate a configurable voucher that customers can purchase as an individual product. The voucher can be configured with all configuration options available in your store coupon-system - e.g. one time use, limited to products/categories etc. The voucher is unique, but not personalized. 

Just follow these steps:
 
#### Create a "gift voucher" product
 
1. In your products catalog create a new category `Gift Voucher`
1. In this new category create a product named e.g. `Gift Voucher 25 USD` (use relevant currency)
    - Select a product description, product image etc.
    - Set a price matching the value of the voucher

Now you have created a new product, which is a voucher and represents the purchase of a voucher with a value of 25 USD. In the next step we will configure the Newsletter Advanced module to automatically send a voucher after the purchase of this product.


####Create a dynamic list of recipients

1. Navigate to MailBeez Newsletter Module `MailBeez > MailBeez Modules > Newsletter Advanced`.
1. On the right hand side, click on button `Edit Lists`.
1. Create a new list, name it e.g. `gift voucher`. Select source `Shop Subscriber`. Click `insert` to save the list.
1. Select the newly created list and click on `edit segmentation` - a new window opens.
1. In the segmentation settings, section `geographical` configure the following:
    - Exclude following countries from newsletter check: (you should enter all relevant countries so the voucher can be sent to a customer regardless if they have subscribed to the newsletter or not).
1. In the segmentation settings, in section `products`, configure the following:
    - Products purchased: Select a voucher product you created e.g. `Gift Voucher 25 USD`.
1. Click `update` to save the segmentation.
1. Click on `Test Segmentation`- you will now see customers matching the segmentation criteria - click on a customer, and the Customer Insight window opens.

You have now created a list which finds all customers who have purchased the product Gift Voucher.
