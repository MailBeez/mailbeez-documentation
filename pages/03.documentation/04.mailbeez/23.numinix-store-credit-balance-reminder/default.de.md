(English) **Developed in Cooperation with Numinix, the inventor of the popular [Numinix Store Credit module](%20http://www.numinix.com/zen-cart-modules/taxes-order-totals/store-credit-and-rewards-points)**

Requirements:

- The Numinix Store Credit & Reward Points addon for Zen Cart
- Zen Cart e-commerce platform

The Numinix Store Credit Balance Reminder module will periodically send a store credit balance reminder to your customers. Once set-up, it will start sending a defined chunk of emails per run to customers with a defined minimum balance amount.

The module easily allows you to configure how often the balance statement will be sent out, with the time delay checked against the Review Reward Module which already contains the updated Balance; a nice feature that avoids spamming customers with too high a frequency of emails with similar content.

**Included**

The [Numinix Store Credit Display Balance](/documentation/filterbeez/filter_add_numinix_sc_balance/ "Numinix Store Credit: Display Balance") Filterbeez Module – allows you to display the current Balance in any MailBeez generated Email !
