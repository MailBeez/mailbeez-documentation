**Say thanks to your customers for giving a review, and send them an automated email with a personalized coupon towards their next purchase with the Mailbeez Review Reward Coupon module.**

If you are already using the [Mailbeez Review Advanced module](/documentation/mailbeez/review_advanced/ "Mailbeez Review Advanced Module") to collect more product reviews for your store, then the new Review Reward Coupon module is a powerful way to augment the review cycle by rewarding customers with a personalized offer coupon email after they have written a review. Fully automated and personalized (for that is the Mailbeez way!), the module offers powerful functionality to send the coupon after a preset number of reviews have been written, and of course, to alter the value of the coupon or deal you wish to offer the reviewer.

**Personalized coupons to prevent code sharing**
