This module works with the [Mailbeez Shoprating System](/dokumentation/configbeez/config_shopvoting/).

**Say thanks to your customers for giving a review, and send them an automated email with a personalized coupon towards their next purchase with the Mailbeez Shoprating Review Reward Coupon module.**

If you are already using the [Mailbeez Shoprating System](/dokumentation/configbeez/config_shopvoting/) to collect Shop reviews for your store, then this Review Reward Coupon module is a powerful way to augment the review cycle by rewarding customers with a personalized offer coupon email after they have written a review. Fully automated and personalized (for that is the Mailbeez way!), the module offers powerful functionality to send the coupon after a preset number of reviews have been written, and of course, to alter the value of the coupon or deal you wish to offer the reviewer.

**Personalized coupons to prevent code sharing**
