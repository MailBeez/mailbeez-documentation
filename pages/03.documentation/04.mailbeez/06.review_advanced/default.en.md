**requires MailBeez V2.5+**

**Turbo charge your eCommerce store’s product reviews, and increase conversion rates with the Mailbeez Review Reminder module with Auto-login. **

Once a customer buys from your store and receives their purchase, they really have no motivation to return at a later date to write a product review. Whilst one or two of your customers will perhaps have a review mindset developed from frequenting larger, more established stores, unfortunately they will always be in the minority.

**The Mailbeez Way!**

The solution to a lack of product reviews is to get proactive, and to this end, Mailbeez offers an easy to set up, fully automated email solution called ‘Review Reminder Advanced’, which is designed to email your customers and invite them to write product reviews for their recent purchase(s); all done in a non-invasive and newsletter status intelligent manner.

**Templates to impress**

Review Advanced ships with some seriously impressive, easily customizable templates. Click below to take a look:

**Want responsive Emails with MailBeez?**  
![](http://www.mailbeez.com/images/responsive.png) ([what are responsive emails?](http://www.mailbeez.com/documentation/responsive-emails/)) In combination with the [responsive template manager](http://www.mailbeez.com/documentation/mailbeez/config_tmplmngr) you are able to select a responsive email template for this module and adopt it to your design.   
The shown themed email templates are not yet responsive, we plan to make that as soon as possible (support for responsive emails will require in any case the [responsive template manager](http://www.mailbeez.com/documentation/mailbeez/config_tmplmngr)). ****

Depending on your store’s image settings, you might need to customize the templates to get the best results. However, you can also create your own templates and the module will add them to the template selector.

**Take a look at some more great features below – click to open!**

###### [Easy Reviewing with Auto-Login – more review](#)

 They bought your products, but customers do not need to jump through hoops just to give you their feedback, so if you can make the whole process as simple as possible, you will be rewarded with greater reviews. Luckily, Mailbeez has got you covered, as the Review Reminder module rocks a seamless ‘auto login’ feature, which automatically signs your customers into your site on click through from the review email, allowing them to start writing straight away. For additional security, the auto login feature is only valid for writing reviews, so other pages of the site, like the “my account” area for example, still require a manual login with their user credentials. To enable the autologin-functionality, you need to modify your store’s “product\_reviews\_write” page by adding 2 lines of codes. However, the download package comes with instructions for all platforms (osCommerce, ZenCart, xtCommerce) to assist you with this.



 

 

###### [Go Social – built-in social sharing](#)

 What better way to work some social media magic than to populate your Review Advanced emails with social sharing options? Courtesy of the new [Mailbeez Social Sharing module](http://www.mailbeez.com/documentation/configbeez/config_social/ "Mailbeez Social Sharing Module"), you can embed your Review Advanced emails with individual product social media links from either Facebook, Twitter, or Google’s new +1; all beautifully styled and easily configurable from the Mailbeez dashboard area.

 

 

###### [Templates on Steroids – great flexibility](#)

 The included templates gives you the best possible control for building custom emails. Multi-column and custom images paths are just a few of the great features available to you in the editing phase. Great control is just the beginning though, as this ships with stylish, easily customizable templates that will give your review campaign a professional, modern look.



 

 

###### [Make Hello, Hola – prepared for fully localization](#)

 For stores selling internationally, the Review Advanced module provides serious adaptability, giving you the tools to fully localize the emails. (requires [Multilanguage Extension with Template Manager](http://www.mailbeez.com/documentation/configbeez/config_tmplmngr_lng/ "Multilanguage Template Manager")) 

 

 

###### [Easier Testing – great for template development](#)

 On install the Review Advanced module selects random products to be used for generating a product list while sending test emails. This is a great feature to have a realistic preview of your templates, but also whilst developing your own templates. 

 

 



## Review Simple vs. Review Advanced

  [Edit](http://localhost/wordpress_mailbeez_EOL/wp-admin/tools.php?page=wp-table-reloaded&action=edit&table_id=4 "Edit")  Review Simple Review Advanced Comment Ask Customer to write a Review PRO\_YES PRO\_YES Getting more Review means increasing revenue! Secure Auto Login PRO\_NO PRO\_YES Customers are signed in automatically and can write right away Up to 3 Reminders PRO\_NO PRO\_YES flexible Workflow to increase the review rate Advanced Layouts PRO\_NO PRO\_YES allow most advanced Layouts e.g. product grids Social Sharing Services PRO\_NO PRO\_YES Allow customers to share products on Facebook etc. Products for Test-Email PRO\_NO PRO\_YES Fill the Test-Email with products – great for template development Professional Templates PRO\_NO PRO\_YES Choose from a list of professional templates Multiple Order Status PRO\_NO PRO\_YES Define a number of order status to react on White Label Emails PRO\_NO PRO\_YES Copyright free Emails**Installed in seconds**

As with all Mailbeez modules, the Review Advanced module is a one step “drop-in” module, so all you have to do is copy a couple of files into your system to get started.

**Up the tempo with the Review-o-Meter**

Follow your review rate within the Mailbeez area of your store with the “[Review-O-Meter](http://www.mailbeez.com/documentation/dashboardbeez/dashboard_review_o_meter/ "Review-O-Meter")” (already part of MailBeez V2.2). This handy visual widget gives you direct feedback on how your store is performing in regard to posted reviews for your products. Fun and informative, it’s just one of the many ways Mailbeez can assist you in increasing both conversion rates, product reviews, and consequently revenue.
