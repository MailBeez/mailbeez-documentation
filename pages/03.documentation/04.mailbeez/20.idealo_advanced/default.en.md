**Get the most out of your Idealo Subscription**

## Advanced Features

This advanced module gives you a couple of settings to streamline and improve the process of inviting customers to give you a rating on Idealo:

## Multiple order status

Do you use different order status? No problem, you decide which order status you want the module to react on.

## Recognition of regular customers

Don't want to bother your regular customers with an invite to rate on Trustpilot? Simply define a delay (e.g. 120 days) between two invites and you're done. The module will check when the last invite was sent and decide whether to wait or to send a new invite.

## Responsive email template

The invitation emails are shown perfectly on all devices.. including mobile.

### Want to integrate your valuable Trustpilot ratings with your marketing efforts?

Using the [Idealo Integration Suite](/documentation/configbeez/config_idealo_rss_importer/), you can easily integrate your Trustpilot ratings with your online shopping-cart - in a way that makes this unique and "fresh" content visible to search engines - and your MailBeez generated marketing emails!
