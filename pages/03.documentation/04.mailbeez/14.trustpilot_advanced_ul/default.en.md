**Get most out of your Trustpilot Subscription**

Automatic Feedback Service Edition: [Trustpilot Advanced](/documentation/mailbeez/trustpilot_advanced/)

**Important:** Unique Links are available only on request and for selected packages.

## Why Trustpilot Unique Links?

In alternativ to Trustpilot's Automatic Feedback Service Store Owner can request to use "unique links" for inviting their customers to review the shop on Trustpilot. The "unique link" technology does no longer require Store Owners to export any customer data to Trustpilot!

This MailBeez Module allows all Store Owner running on MailBeez compatible Stores to utilise the Trustpilot Unique Link technology! (Trustpilot needs to allow the usage of unique links).

In addition this module offers a range of intelligent features:

## customize your Emails

Using the MailBeez Template system you can fully customise the Invitation to your needs!

[plugin:content-inject](/content_blocks/pro_responsive_template)

## multiple order status

Do you have different order status marking orders as shipped! No problem, just check all orders status you want the module to react on

## delay times for international orders

Shipping to international customers typically takes a couple days longer. To avoid sending a rating invite before delivery, you can define an additional delay for orders shipping to other countries than your own!

The module automatically applies this delay to all orders which are shipped to a country, which is different from the country you configured in your store system.

## recognition of regular customers

Don't want to bother your regular customers with an Email to rate on Trustpilot? Simply define a delay (e.g. 120 days) between to invites and your are done. The module will check when the last invite was sent and decides whether to wait or to send a new rating invite.

## Multilingual?

Sure! In combination with the module [Multilanguage Extension with Template Manager](/documentation/configbeez/config_tmplmngr_lng/) customers will receive the invitation email in their language with a link to the matching Trustpilot site!

English speaking customers will receive an email written in english linking to Trustpilot.com (or trustpilot.co.uk) while spanish speaking customers will receive an invitation email written in spanish linking to the matching site es.trustpilot.com

### Want to integrated your valuable ratings with your Store and Email Marketing?

Using the [Trustpilot Integration Suite](/documentation/configbeez/config_trustpilot_rss_importer/) you can easily integrate your Trustpilot-Ratings with your Store - in a way that makes this "unique fresh content" visible to search engines - and your MailBeez generated Email Marketing emails!
