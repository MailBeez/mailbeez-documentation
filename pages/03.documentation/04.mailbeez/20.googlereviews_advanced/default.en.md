**Get real reviews on Google - automatically**

Precondition: You must have a confirmed "Google My Business" account. There you can find your short URL for customer reviews. Read more on https://support.google.com/business/answer/7035772?hl=en


## Advanced Features

this advanced module gives you a couple of settings to streamline and improve your process of inviting customers to give a rating on Google:

## multiple order status

Do you have different order status marking orders as shipped! No problem, just check all orders status you want the module to react on

## Delay times for international orders

Shipping to international customers typically takes a couple days longer. To avoid sending a rating invite before delivery, you can define an additional delay for orders shipping to countries other than your own!

The module automatically applies this delay to all orders which are shipped to a country, which is different from the home country you configured in your shopping-cart system.

## recognition of regular customers

Don't want to bother your regular customers with an Email to rate on Googlereviews.de? Simply define a delay (e.g. 120 days) between to invites and your are done. The module will check when the last invite was sent and decides whether to wait or to send a new rating invite.

## responsive email template

the emails are shown perfectly also on mobile deviced
