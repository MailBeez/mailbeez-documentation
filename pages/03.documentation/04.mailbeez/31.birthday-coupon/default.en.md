**When cake and party poppers time comes around for your customers, roll out the red carpet to your store, and offer a Happy Birthday coupon with the Mailbeez Birthday Coupon Module!**

Fully automated, personalized and complete with configurable expiry dates, the Mailbeez Birthday Coupon module gives you the tools to let your customers know you are thinking about them during their special day.

**Auto-generated coupons**

The Birthday module takes advantage of Mailbeez’s intelligent architecture by providing your store with the ability to send an individual, personalized coupon to each customer. The dynamically generated coupon in the Birthday mail is fed by a “Master Coupon” in your online store’s coupon admin area – a coupon which then feeds into the Birthday module for Mailbeez to personalize. For more information on how Mailbeez auto-generates personalized coupons, [please click here](http://www.mailbeez.com/blog/configuring-coupons-mailbeez-campaigns/ "Configuring coupons for Mailbeez Campaigns").

**A good email starts with great content**

Like all MailBeez Modules, the email content itself is taken from a template file, which can be customized without touching any code.

**Want responsive Emails with MailBeez?**  
![](http://www.mailbeez.com/images/responsive.png) ([what are responsive emails?](http://www.mailbeez.com/documentation/responsive-emails/)) In combination with the [responsive template manager](http://www.mailbeez.com/documentation/mailbeez/config_tmplmngr) you are able to select a responsive email template for this module and adopt it to your design.   
The shown themed email templates are not yet responsive, we plan to make that as soon as possible (support for responsive emails will require in any case the [responsive template manager](http://www.mailbeez.com/documentation/mailbeez/config_tmplmngr)). ****

Just in case ‘Dave’ isn’t the name of every one of your customers, Mailbeez emails support dynamic placeholder data, so you can ensure that every email your store sends is fully personalized with the first name, full name, or a number of growing dynamic elements available from your store’s database, all through simple ‘drop in’ code snippets.

**A second chance with every email**

Like most internet users, your customers probably receive a lot of email, so there is of course a chance that the Mailbeez Birthday email will be overlooked in the hullabaloo of inbox emailing. In order to prevent this, or at least to maximize the chance that your email will be viewed and acted upon, the Birthday Coupon Module actively tracks which customers received a coupon, allowing you to follow up with a simple [coupon expiry reminder](http://localhost/wordpress_mailbeez_EOL/documentation/mailbeez/coupon-expiry-reminder/) in case the coupon is still unused after a set time.

**Configuration options**

The Birthday module offers some handy configuration options which are detailed below.

- **Set days before:** Send greeting this many days before Birthday
- **Set days to skip after:** Stop looking for Birthday greetings this many days after Birthday
- **Choose Coupon as template:** Choose the coupon code you have configured in your store’s coupon system. This coupon will be used as template to generate a personalized, unique coupon for each recipient. For precise instructions on how to properly work with coupons, [view this blog post](http://www.mailbeez.com/blog/configuring-coupons-mailbeez-campaigns/ "Configuring coupons for Mailbeez Campaigns").
- **Expires after days:** Number of days after which the coupon expires – calculated from the sending point of time
- **Length of Coupon Code:** Sets the length of the automatically generated coupon code
