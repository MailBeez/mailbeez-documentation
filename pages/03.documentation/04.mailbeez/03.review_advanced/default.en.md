**Turbo charge your eCommerce store’s product reviews, and increase conversion rates with the Mailbeez Review Reminder module with Auto-login. **

Once a customer buys from your store and receives their purchase, they really have no motivation to return at a later date to write a product review. Whilst one or two of your customers will perhaps have a review mindset developed from frequenting larger, more established stores, unfortunately they will always be in the minority.

**The Mailbeez Way!**

The solution to a lack of product reviews is to get proactive, and to this end, Mailbeez offers an easy to set up, fully automated email solution called ‘Review Reminder Advanced’, which is designed to email your customers and invite them to write product reviews for their recent purchase(s); all done in a non-invasive and newsletter status intelligent manner.

Depending on your store’s image settings, you might need to customize the templates to get the best results. However, you can also create your own templates and the module will add them to the template selector.

#### Take a look at some more great features

**Easy Reviewing with Auto-Login – more review**

 They bought your products, but customers do not need to jump through hoops just to give you their feedback, so if you can make the whole process as simple as possible, you will be rewarded with greater reviews. Luckily, Mailbeez has got you covered, as the Review Reminder module rocks a seamless ‘auto login’ feature, which automatically signs your customers into your site on click through from the review email, allowing them to start writing straight away. For additional security, the auto login feature is only valid for writing reviews, so other pages of the site, like the “my account” area for example, still require a manual login with their user credentials. To enable the autologin-functionality, you need to modify your store’s “product\_reviews\_write” page by adding 2 lines of codes. However, the download package comes with instructions for all platforms (osCommerce, ZenCart, xtCommerce) to assist you with this.

#### Up the tempo with the Review-o-Meter

Follow your review rate within the Mailbeez area of your store with the “[Review-O-Meter](/documentation/dashboardbeez/dashboard_review_o_meter/ "Review-O-Meter")” (already part of your MailBeez platform). This handy visual widget gives you direct feedback on how your store is performing in regard to posted reviews for your products. Fun and informative, it’s just one of the many ways Mailbeez can assist you in increasing both conversion rates, product reviews, and consequently revenue.
