**Requires MailBeez V2.5+**

**In which Mailbeez daringly assists you in the reactivation of previously good customers.**

Getting new customers is great, and seeing all your hard work pay off when an order comes through is one of the best feelings a store owner can experience. However, with the constant drive to find new customers comes the risk that existing customers will get overlooked – customers you were once just as excited to welcome to your store.

**The Mailbeez way!**

In order to prevent formerly good customers from falling through the cracks of your marketing strategy, Mailbeez has developed a deceptively powerful, fully automated module called Winback Advanced, which gives you the tools to email old customers who haven’t placed an order for a pre-determined time span (set in the admin area), both reminding them of your presence, and enticing them back with personalised offers.

**A personalized coupon for every customer**

When you contact an inactive customer, it is wise to give them an additional incentive to return. Just imagine if you hadn’t been to a store in several months, you might expect a coupon just to sweeten the return, and that funnily enough, is exactly what your customer’s will expect.

With Winback Advanced, not only can you send a personalized one-off coupon to formerly long lost customers, but as part of its multi-step architecture, if the customer still isn’t returning, Winback can raise the stakes over a series of emails with pre-configured time delays, all embedded with offer coupons that can be set to increase in value in line with the multi-step process; until the customer simply *cannot* resist the deal you are offering.

**Top features of Winback Advanced**

- Fully automated customer contact – just set and forget
- Time delay configurable multi step emailing
- Entice old customers back with personalised offer coupons that can be set to increase in value in line with the multi step process. [Click here](http://www.mailbeez.com/blog/configuring-coupons-mailbeez-campaigns/ "Configuring coupons for Mailbeez Campaigns") to read how Mailbeez creates personalized coupons
- Remind customers what they have previously bought by adding their purchased products into their email

**Email templates for inbox love**

The key to winning your customer’s inbox loyalty is to send attractive, clearly presented emails, and here Winback excels with included, professionally designed templates that put on emphasis on high conversions and click through rates.

**Want responsive Emails with MailBeez?**  
![](http://www.mailbeez.com/images/responsive.png) ([what are responsive emails?](/documentation/responsive-emails/)) In combination with the [responsive template manager](/documentation/mailbeez/config_tmplmngr) you are able to select a responsive email template for this module and adopt it to your design.   
The shown themed email templates are not yet responsive, we plan to make that as soon as possible (support for responsive emails will require in any case the [responsive template manager](/documentation/mailbeez/config_tmplmngr)). ****


Depending on your image settings, you might need to customize the included templates for the best results. In addition, you can also create your own templates and the module will add them to the template selector.

###### [Coupons](#)

 **Powerful Winback Campaigns**  
 The Winback advanced module generates fully configurable individual coupons – great to create a sense of urgency and also follow-up before expiry date ([Coupon Expiry Reminder](/documentation/mailbeez/coupon_expire/ "Coupon: Send Coupon Expiry Reminder"))

 

 

###### [Go Social – built-in social sharing](#)

 What better way to work some social media magic than to populate your Winback Advanced emails with social sharing options? Courtesy of the new [Mailbeez Social Sharing module](/documentation/configbeez/config_social/ "Mailbeez Social Sharing Module"), you can embed your Winback Advanced emails with individual product social media links from either Facebook, Twitter, or Google’s new +1; all beautifully styled and easily configurable from the Mailbeez dashboard area.

 

 

###### [Templates on Steroids – great flexibility](#)

 The included templates gives you the best possible control for building custom emails. Multi-column and custom images paths are just a few of the great features available to you in the editing phase. Great control is just the beginning though, as this ships with stylish, easily customizable templates that will give your review campaign a professional, modern look.



 

 

###### [Make Hello, Hola – prepared for fully localization](#)

 For stores selling internationally, the Winback Advanced module provides serious adaptability, giving you the tools to fully localize the emails. (requires [Multilanguage Extension with Template Manager](/documentation/configbeez/config_tmplmngr_lng/ "Multilanguage Template Manager")) 

 

 

###### [Easier Testing – great for template development](#)

 On install the Winback Advanced module selects random products to be used for generating a product list while sending test emails. This is a great feature to have a realistic preview of your templates, but also whilst developing your own templates. 

 

 



## Winback Simple vs. Winback Advanced

  [Edit](http://localhost/wordpress_mailbeez_EOL/wp-admin/tools.php?page=wp-table-reloaded&action=edit&table_id=5 "Edit")  Winback Simple Winback Advanced Comment Contact Customers after a defined period of time w/o purchase PRO\_YES PRO\_YES Don’t leave your customers alone personalized Coupons with expiration date PRO\_NO PRO\_YES fully configurable personalized coupons are added 3 different Steps + endless loop PRO\_NO PRO\_YES flexible Workflow to increase the winback rate Advanced Layouts PRO\_NO PRO\_YES allow most advanced Layouts e.g. product grids List of last purchased products PRO\_NO PRO\_YES Remember Customers what they have purchased Social Sharing Services PRO\_NO PRO\_YES Allow customers to share products on Facebook etc. Products for Test-Email PRO\_NO PRO\_YES Fill the Test-Email with products – great for template development Professional Templates PRO\_NO PRO\_YES Choose from a list of professional templates Multiple Order Status PRO\_NO PRO\_YES Define a number of order status to react on White Label Emails PRO\_NO PRO\_YES Copyright free Emails**Installed in seconds**

As with all Mailbeez modules, setting up is a breeze, so to get started, simply create your template and set the time delay before the email is sent – then let that baby run.

## See the results

Mailbeez is pre installed with some great reporting widgets, one of which is the Winback-O-Meter, which easily allows you to see what percentage of customers are re-ordering off the back of your new Winback email campaign, right from within your store’s admin area.
