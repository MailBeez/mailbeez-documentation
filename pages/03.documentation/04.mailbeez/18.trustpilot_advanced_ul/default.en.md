**Get the most out of your Trustpilot Subscription**

See the Automatic Feedback Service edition here: [Trustpilot Advanced](/documentation/mailbeez/trustpilot_advanced/)

**Important:** Unique Links are available only on request and for selected packages.

## Why Trustpilot Unique Links?

As an alternativ to Trustpilot's Automatic Feedback Service, an online business can request to use "unique links" for inviting their customers to review their business on Trustpilot. The "unique link" technology no longer requires businesses to export any customer data to Trustpilot!

This MailBeez Module allows any shopping-cart running on MailBeez compatible systems to utilise the Trustpilot Unique Link technology! (Trustpilot seperately allows the usage of unique links.)

In addition, this module offers a range of intelligent features:

## Customize your invitations

Using the MailBeez Template system you can fully customise the email invites to your needs!

[plugin:content-inject](/content_blocks/pro_responsive_template)

## Multiple order status

Do you use different order status? No problem, you decide which orders status you want the module to react on.

## Delay times for international orders

Shipping to international customers typically takes a couple days longer. To avoid sending a rating invite before delivery, you can define an additional delay for orders shipping to other countries than your own!

The module automatically applies this delay to all orders which are shipped to a country, which is different from the home country you configured in your shopping-cart system.

## Recognition of regular customers

Don't want to bother your regular customers with an invite to rate on Trustpilot? Simply define a delay (e.g. 120 days) between two invites and you're done. The module will check when the last invite was sent and decide whether to wait or to send a new invite.

## Multilingual?

Sure! In combination with the module [Multilanguage Extension with Template Manager](/documentation/configbeez/config_tmplmngr_lng/) customers can receive an invitation written in their local language, with a link to the Trustpilot site of the same language!

For example; english speaking customers will receive an email written in english linking to Trustpilot.com (or trustpilot.co.uk) while spanish speaking customers will receive an invitation email written in spanish linking to the matching site es.trustpilot.com

### Want to integrate your valuable Trustpilot ratings with your marketing efforts?

Using the [Trustpilot Integration Suite](/documentation/configbeez/config_trustpilot_rss_importer/), you can easily integrate your Trustpilot ratings with your online shopping-cart - in a way that makes this unique and "fresh" content visible to search engines - and your MailBeez generated marketing emails!
