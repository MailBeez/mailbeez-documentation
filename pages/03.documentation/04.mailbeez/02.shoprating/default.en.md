This module to invite your customers to rate your store is already included in [Shopvoting](http://www.mailbeez.com/documentation/configbeez/config_shopvoting/)

The shopvoting module allows your customers to rate your store. You can edit these ratings in your store admin and display them on your storefront.

This module allows store-owners to automatically invite their customers to rate their store.

For a progressional application of the shop voting module please use the MailBeez Module "[Shopvote invite advanced](http://www.mailbeez.com/documentation/mailbeez/shoprating_advanced/ "shop voting advanced")", which will generate up to twice as many ratings and allows you to dynamically integrate them into your MailBeez Emails e.g. [Winback Advanced](http://www.mailbeez.com/documentation/mailbeez/winback_advanced/)
