This module invites your customers to write a review using the included [Shopvoting](/documentation/configbeez/config_shopvoting/) module.

The shopvoting module allows your customers to rate your store. You can edit these ratings in your store admin and display them on your storefront.


For a progressional application of the shop voting module please use the MailBeez Module "[Shopvote invite advanced](/documentation/mailbeez/shoprating_advanced/ "shop voting advanced")", which will generate up to twice as many ratings and allows you to dynamically integrate them into your MailBeez Emails e.g. [Winback Advanced](/documentation/mailbeez/winback_advanced/)
