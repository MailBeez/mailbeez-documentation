**For stores new to the world of email marketing, the Mailbeez Review Simple module gives you the tools to automate product review requests.**

Once a customer has bought from your store, if you offer the ability to write product reviews on your product pages, then the next logical step is to start emailing your customers in order to get more reviews for your products, and of course, more content for your store – and this is exactly what the Review Simple module from Mailbeez gives you the tools to do.

**Great for stores just starting out**

Whilst Review Simple does not include the more advanced features of the [Review Advanced Module](http://www.mailbeez.com/documentation/mailbeez/review_advanced "Review Advanced"), a module we would recommend you upgrade to once you have tested Review Simple for a few days, nevertheless it will allow you to start automatically emailing customers with product review requests straight out of the box.

**Easily installed and configured**

Like all Mailbeez modules, even the extremely powerful Advanced modules, Review Simple is very simple to install and configure. Installation is usually a case of just transferring a few files into your FTP, whilst configuration is via the Mailbeez module controls in your store’s admin area; an environment you are already familiar very familiar with.
