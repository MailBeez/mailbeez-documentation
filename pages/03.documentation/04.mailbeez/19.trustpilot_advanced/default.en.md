**Get the most out of your Trustpilot Subscription**

See the Trustpilot Unique Link Edition here: [Trustpilot Advanced Unique Link Edition](/documentation/mailbeez/trustpilot_advanced_ul/)



## Invite for Service- & Productreviews

Trustpilot’s Service Reviews strengthen relationships between companies and customers. Trustpilot’s Product Reviews complement Service Reviews, helping customers make informed purchase decisions.

Does your Trustpilot Subscription support product reviews? Great, this module allows you to automatically invite your customers to review their purchased products as well.

And thanks to the seamless integration of MailBeez with your Store System, you can invite your existing customer base for reviews - within a configurable timeframe without any additional efforts.



## Advanced Features

By integrating with the Trustpilot Feedback Service, this advanced module gives you a couple of settings to streamline and improve the process of inviting your customers to provide a rating on Trustpilot.

## Multiple order status

Do you use different order status? No problem, you decide which orders status you want the module to react on.

## Delay times for international orders

Shipping to international customers typically takes a couple days longer. To avoid sending a rating invite before delivery, you can define an additional delay for orders shipping to other countries than your own!

The module automatically applies this delay to all orders which are shipped to a country, which is different from the home country you configured in your shopping-cart system.

## Recognition of regular customers

Don't want to bother your regular customers with an invite to rate on Trustpilot? Simply define a delay (e.g. 120 days) between two invites and you're done. The module will check when the last invite was sent and decide whether to wait or to send a new invite.

### Want to integrate your valuable Trustpilot ratings with your marketing efforts?

Using the [Trustpilot Integration Suite](/documentation/configbeez/config_trustpilot_rss_importer/), you can easily integrate your Trustpilot ratings with your online shopping-cart - in a way that makes this unique and "fresh" content visible to search engines - and your MailBeez generated marketing emails!
