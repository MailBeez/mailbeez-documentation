**Get most out of your Trustedshops Subscription**

## Advanced Features

compared to the free, basic module to ask your customers for a rating on Trustedshops, this advanced module gives you a couple of settings to streamline and improve your process of inviting customers to give a rating on Trustedshops:

## multiple order status

Do you have different order status marking orders as shipped! No problem, just check all orders status you want the module to react on

## delay times for international orders

Shipping to international customers typically takes a couple days longer. To avoid sending a rating invite before delivery, you can define an additional delay for orders shipping to other countries than your own!

The module automatically applies this delay to all orders which are shipped to a country, which is different from the country you configured in your store system.

## recognition of regular customers

Don't want to bother your regular customers with an Email to rate on Trustedshops? Simply define a delay (e.g. 120 days) between to invites and your are done. The module will check when the last invite was sent and decides whether to wait or to send a new rating invite.

### Want to integrated your valuable ratings with your Store and Email Marketing?

Using the [Trustedshops Integration Suite](/documentation/configbeez/config_trustedshops_rss_importer/) you can easily integrate your Trustedshops-Ratings with your Store - in a way that makes this "unique fresh content" visible to search engines - and your MailBeez generated Email Marketing emails!
