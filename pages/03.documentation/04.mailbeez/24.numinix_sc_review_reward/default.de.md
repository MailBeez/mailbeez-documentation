**Developed in Cooperation with Numinix, the inventor of the popular [Numinix Store Credit module](https://www.numinix.com/plugins/zen-cart-plugins/taxes-order-totals/store-credit-and-reward-dollars?referral_code=888671548)**


The Numinix Store Credit Review Rewards module will automatically assign and email notification of rewards points to your customers after they write one or more approved product reviews. 

The module looks for newly approved reviews in store and waits a defined period of time to allow the customer to write additional reviews. 


You can of course define the amount of reward per review, but only one reward is given per order.
