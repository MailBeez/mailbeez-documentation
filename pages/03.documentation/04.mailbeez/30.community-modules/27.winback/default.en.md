**Start reactivating non-buying older customers with the Mailbeez Winback Simple Email module**

For stores new to the world of online selling, or for curious retailers looking to explore Mailbeez before purchasing a more comprehensive Advanced Mailbeez module, Winback Simple is a handy, time-saving solution that will kick-start your store’s email marketing efforts, and begin automatically emailing customers who haven’t bought from your store for a set period of time.

**Bring it right back**

Whilst the free version of Winback does not give you the more advanced features and flexibility that your store will eventually need as your email marketing aims develop (this functionality can be found in the [Mailbeez Advanced Winback module](/documentation/mailbeez/winback_advanced "Advanced Winback")), nevertheless it will allow your store to automatically email older customers who have not bought for a set period in an attempt to entice them back to your store.

**Easily installed and configured**

Winback Simple, like all Mailbeez modules, even the extremely powerful Advanced modules, is very simple to install and configure. Installation is usually a case of just transferring a few files into your FTP, whilst configuration is via the Mailbeez module controls in your store’s admin area; an environment you are already familiar very familiar with.
