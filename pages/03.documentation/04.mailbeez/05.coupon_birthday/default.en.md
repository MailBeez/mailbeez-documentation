**When cake and party poppers time comes around for your customers, roll out the red carpet to your store, and offer a Happy Birthday coupon with the Mailbeez Birthday Coupon Module!**

Fully automated, personalized and complete with configurable expiry dates, the Mailbeez Birthday Coupon module gives you the tools to let your customers know you are thinking about them during their special day.

**Auto-generated coupons**

Just in case ‘Dave’ isn’t the name of every one of your customers, Mailbeez emails support dynamic placeholder data, so you can ensure that every email your store sends is fully personalized with the first name, full name, or a number of growing dynamic elements available from your store’s database, all through simple ‘drop in’ code snippets.

**A second chance with every email**

Like most internet users, your customers probably receive a lot of email, so there is of course a chance that the Mailbeez Birthday email will be overlooked in the hullabaloo of inbox emailing. In order to prevent this, or at least to maximize the chance that your email will be viewed and acted upon, the Birthday Coupon Module actively tracks which customers received a coupon, allowing you to follow up with a simple [coupon expiry reminder](http://localhost/wordpress_mailbeez_EOL/documentation/mailbeez/coupon-expiry-reminder/) in case the coupon is still unused after a set time.

**Configuration options**

The Birthday module offers some handy configuration options which are detailed below.

- **Set days before:** Send greeting this many days before Birthday
- **Set days to skip after:** Stop looking for Birthday greetings this many days after Birthday
- **Choose Coupon as template:** Choose the coupon code you have configured in your store’s coupon system. This coupon will be used as template to generate a personalized, unique coupon for each recipient. For precise instructions on how to properly work with coupons, [view this blog post](http://www.mailbeez.com/blog/configuring-coupons-mailbeez-campaigns/ "Configuring coupons for Mailbeez Campaigns").
- **Expires after days:** Number of days after which the coupon expires – calculated from the sending point of time
- **Length of Coupon Code:** Sets the length of the automatically generated coupon code
