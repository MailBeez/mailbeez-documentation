More Reviews gives more Customers

**Get additional 8-10% of your customers writing a review of purchased products**

This module reminds your customers to write a review in case they haven’t done it yet.

Based on the free “Review Reminder” this MailBeez Module does the following

- check who has received the “Review Reminder” email
- check for each customer per purchased product if a review is given or not
- check if the customer has blocked (opt-out) the “Review Reminder” (otherwise you will get very angry emails – belive me ![;-)](http://localhost/wordpress_mailbeez_EOL/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif) )
- build an email with direct links into the review pages for the products NOT reviewed yet

Like the “Review Reminder” the email contains a list of purchased products with

- Image
- “Write a Review Button” (taken from you theme)
- direct link to the review page of the product

Like all MailBeez Moduls the email content is taken from a template, the list of products is defined in a sub-template.

This module uses the same sub-templates for listing the products, but has separate templates for the email subject and body.

Configuration:

- Send Review Reminder Plus
- Set days passed after first reminder
- Set days passed after first reminder to skip after

all other settings are taken from the “Review Reminder” module for easy configuration.
