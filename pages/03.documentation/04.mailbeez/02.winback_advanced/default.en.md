**In which Mailbeez daringly assists you in the reactivation of previously good customers.**

Getting new customers is great, and seeing all your hard work pay off when an order comes through is one of the best feelings a store owner can experience. However, with the constant drive to find new customers comes the risk that existing customers will get overlooked – customers you were once just as excited to welcome to your store.

**The Mailbeez way!**

In order to prevent formerly good customers from falling through the cracks of your marketing strategy, Mailbeez has developed a deceptively powerful, fully automated module called Winback Advanced, which gives you the tools to email old customers who haven’t placed an order for a pre-determined time span (set in the admin area), both reminding them of your presence, and enticing them back with personalised offers.

**A personalized coupon for every customer**

When you contact an inactive customer, it is wise to give them an additional incentive to return. Just imagine if you hadn’t been to a store in several months, you might expect a coupon just to sweeten the return, and that funnily enough, is exactly what your customer’s will expect.

With Winback Advanced, not only can you send a personalized one-off coupon to formerly long lost customers, but as part of its multi-step architecture, if the customer still isn’t returning, Winback can raise the stakes over a series of emails with pre-configured time delays, all embedded with offer coupons that can be set to increase in value in line with the multi-step process; until the customer simply *cannot* resist the deal you are offering.

**Top features of Winback Advanced**

- Fully automated customer contact – just set and forget
- Time delay configurable multi step emailing
- Entice old customers back with personalised offer coupons that can be set to increase in value in line with the multi step process.
- Remind customers what they have previously bought by adding their purchased products into their email

Depending on your image settings, you might need to customize the included templates for the best results. In addition, you can also create your own templates and the module will add them to the template selector.

Mailbeez is pre installed with some great reporting widgets, one of which is the Winback-O-Meter, which easily allows you to see what percentage of customers are re-ordering off the back of your new Winback email campaign, right from within your store’s admin area.
