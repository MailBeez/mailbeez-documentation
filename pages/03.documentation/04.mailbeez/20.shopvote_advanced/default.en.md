**Get the most out of your ShopVote.de subscription**

## Advanced features

This advanced module gives you a couple of settings to streamline and improve the process of inviting your customers to provide a rating on ShopVote.de:

## Multiple order status

Do you use different order status? No problem, you decide which order status you want the module to react on.

## Recognition of regular customers

Don't want to bother your regular customers with an invite to rate on Trustpilot? Simply define a delay (e.g. 120 days) between two invites and you're done. The module will check when the last invite was sent and decide whether to wait or to send a new invite.

## Responsive email template

The invitation emails are shown perfectly on any device.. including mobile phones.
