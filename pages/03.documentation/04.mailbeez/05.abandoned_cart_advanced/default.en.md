Target **abandoned carts** for existing customers - effective and fully automatized

New customer, which signed up, but never order can be followed up with [No Purchase Advanced](/documentation/mailbeez/nopurchase_advanced).

**Most important Features**

- Finds and contacts customers with open carts
- Fully automated customer contact â€“ just set and forget
- Time delay configurable multi-step emailing
- With each step you optionally can provide a tempting coupon

With a configurable sequence of emails you can reminder you existing customers of items left in their cart - waiting to get ordered.


>>>>>>The modules [Winback Advanced](/documentation/mailbeez/winback_advanced) and [Reorder Advanced](/documentation/mailbeez/reorder_advanced) check for empty carts (configurable) to avoid overlapping campaigns: Customers with products in their carts will not receive these types of emails.
