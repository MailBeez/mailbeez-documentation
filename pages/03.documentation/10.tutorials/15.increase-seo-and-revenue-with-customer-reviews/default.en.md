## Product Reviews

The modern consensus is that the greater the amount of relevant reviews for a product on an eCommerce store, the greater the sales. However, actually collecting these reviews has been difficult in the past, so let’s take a look at the Mailbeez solution.

Mailbeez offers an easy to set up, fully automated solution called ‘[Review Reminder Advanced](/documentation/mailbeez/review_advanced/ "Review Reminder Advanced – Autologin")’ to collect reviews from your customers, all done in a non invasive and newsletter status intelligent manner.

Simple create your template, select the time delay between despatch and review collection, and then [set up a cron job](/documentation/configbeez/config_cron_simple/ "Run MailBeez Automatically") on your server to fire off the reviews – fit and forget simpleness!

Getting more reviews is all well and good, but what advantages will you typically see for your store from using Mailbeez?

Top benefits to acquiring product reviews through Mailbeez:

- Develop repeat visits as your customers return to post their review
- Drive keyword rich content and relevancy for improved SEO
- Increase in conversion rates as your product review catalogue increases
- Fully automated solution that quickly increases the number of reviews in your store
- Unsubscribe control

 

**Tip:**

Use the [Review-O-Meter](/documentation/dashboardbeez/dashboard_review_o_meter/ "Review-O-Meter") (already part of MailBeez V2.2) to monitor your Review effectiveness.

It is fun to watch how the review rate increases – and very likely also your revenue.

Now you know how you can get more reviews, but will your visitors believe them? There are modules available on the internet which mass-import fake reviews into stores, so this is really about building trust. If you are able to build trust around your store, your reviews will gain credibility as well.

## Trust – you either have it or you don’t

With the rise of fraud across the internet, e-commerce companies have become ever more sensitive to the power of trust in the eyes of their customers. Luckily, Mailbeez gives you the tools to take control of your brand, and drive trust at the same time, via a great independent review site called Trustpilot.com in conjunction with the [Mailbeez Trustpilot ](/documentation/mailbeez/trustpilot/ "Trustpilot – Turn Visitors into Customers")module .

Product reviews help customers decide what they want, but reviews of your store displayed in key areas across your site, will help generate invaluable trust for your brand, driving revenue and increasing conversion rates.

Outside of your eco-system, these reviews will also appear next to your Google Shopping results, taking the trust you have accumulated into the wider web, aiding click conversions from shoppers looking for the products you sell.

With the [Trustpilot Integration Suite](/documentation/configbeez/config_trustpilot_rss_importer/ "Trustpilot Integration Suite") you are also able to re-purpose your valuable reviews not only by displaying them most attractive in your storefront  but also by adding them to your MailBeez email campaigns.

So suddenly things make sense and nothing stops you growing your online business!
