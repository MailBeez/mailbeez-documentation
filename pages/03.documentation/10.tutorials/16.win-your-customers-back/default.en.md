## Increase your repeat order rate with Mailbeez

Nearly everyone will tell you that new customers are the lifeblood of you business, and of course, they are essential; but did you ever stop to ask yourself how important your existing customers are?

From that magical moment when a new customer places their first order, the relationship between you and that customer has begun. Skip forward a few weeks though, and with the multitude of tasks and pressures involved in the management of your store, this customer, the one that trusted you with their business, is all but forgotten in the continual drive to find new customers.

## Winback the customer

In order to prevent formerly good customers from falling through the cracks of your marketing strategy, Mailbeez has developed a deceptively powerful, fully automated module called ‘[Winback Advanced](http://www.mailbeez.com/documentation/mailbeez/winback_advanced/ "Winback Advanced")’, which allows you to easily contact customers that haven’t placed an order for a pre-determined time span (set in the admin area), both reminding them of your presence, and enticing them back with personalised offers.

## Top features of Winback Advanced

- Automated customer contact
- Time delay configurable multi step emailing
- Entice old customers back with personalised offer coupons that can be set to increase in value in line with the multi step process
- Remind customers what they bought by adding their purchased products into their email

As with all Mailbeez modules, setting up is a breeze, so to get started, simply create your template, set the time delay before the email is sent, and let that baby run

## See the results

Mailbeez is pre installed with some great reporting widgets, one of which is the Winback-O-Meter, which easily allows you to see what percentage of customers are re-ordering off the back of your new Winback email campaign, right from within your store’s admin area.
