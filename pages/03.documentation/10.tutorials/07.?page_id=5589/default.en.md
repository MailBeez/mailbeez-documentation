## Understanding Premium Email Templates

### Template Overview

Premium email templates are very different from free email templates in that there are many more layers to them. These layers provide increased flexibility that allows for richer customization & design:

- Common Main Template (the Theme Template)
- Professionally designed Layout Style sub-templates
- Product List sub-templates, if module uses product lists
- Social Sharing sub-templates, if module uses product lists
- Coupon sub-templates, if module uses coupons
- Additional body sub-templates in each of the 4 layout styles, if module generates sequential emails

With MailBeez, you have complete control over all of it because every template and sub-template can be customized to suit your needs. Additionally, you can customize the Common Main template to create a Theme, create as many customized Layout Style templates as you want to, and switch between them as desired. And thanks to the sub-template system, styles can be mixed and matched to create a whole new style that’s all your own!

Because Mailbeez emails are 100% template based, they can be customized without any programming knowledge whatsoever. As long as you are comfortable with a little HTML editing, you will be able to make all the customizations you desire.

The end result is nicer emails for your customers and increased revenue for you!

### Template Structure

Premium email templates are structured in such a way as to allow MailBeez to build your emails in a nested or hierarchical fashion by pulling content from various templates and putting it all together in one email just before its sent out.

Sub-template content is nested inside body template content, which is nested inside the Common Main template/Theme template content. This hierarchical structure allows for virtually unlimited flexibility in customizing template layout & design.

Visually, the template hierarchy of the premium modules looks like this:

Common Main Template/Theme Template  
 This content will apply to all emails generated by MailBeez Module specific Body Template/Layout Style Template  
 Content is merged into the Theme template content by the html code {$body} Product List sub-template\*  
 Content is merged into the body template content by the html code {$list\_engine.productlist} Social Sharing sub-template\*  
 Content is merged into the product list template content by the html code {$products[product].social}

 

Coupon sub-template\*  
 Content is merged into the body template content by the html code {$coupon.coupon}

 

 

*\*if used by the Module*

## Understanding Themes Vs. Layout Styles

This section provides a high level overview of Themes and Layout styles. The purpose is to compare & contrast them so that when you begin editing your custom versions, you’ll feel comfortable doing so.

### Themes vs. Layout Styles

What’s the difference between Themes and Layout Styles?

- Themes are global; they affect **all** emails. Layout Styles are modular; they affect emails on a module-by-module basis
- Themes utilize the Common Main templates, Layout Styles utilize the Individual Module templates
- When you edit Theme templates, you’re editing Common Main templates, When you edit Layout Style templates, you’re editing individual module templates
- Themes provide the overall look & feel of your emails, Layout Styles add module specific styling & content

### Using Themes vs. Layout Styles

Here are some examples of customizations which you might apply to a theme template:

- Header image
- Default font, font size, and font color
- Signature
- Footer

Here are some examples of customizations which you might apply to a layout style template:

- Images
- Text & content
- Product list styling
- Background color

## Understanding Layout Style Templates

Each premium email module comes packaged with 4 professionally designed templates, each one offering a unique style and layout: “default”, “fashion”, “friendly” and “simple columns”:

[![](http://localhost/wordpress_mailbeez_EOL/wp-content/themes/awake/lib/scripts/timthumb/thumb.php?src=http://www.mailbeez.com/images/doc/premium_email_tut/layout_selector_default.png&w=175&h=97&zc=1&q=100 "Layout Style Selector")](http://www.mailbeez.com/images/doc/premium_email_tut/layout_selector_default.png "Layout Style Selector")![](http://localhost/wordpress_mailbeez_EOL/wp-content/themes/awake/images/shortcodes/image_shadow.png)

Whenever a Layout Style is selected within an email module, the same presentation of product lists, social sharing services and coupons is used across all emails generated by that module.

The Layout Styles consist of a set of sub-template files for the email’s main body, product lists, social sharing, and coupon elements. (Included sub-templates vary by module, as not all modules include coupons or product lists in their generated emails).

A Layout Style’s body sub-templates are located in the email folder of the individual modules, whereas a Layout Style’s sub-templates for product lists, social sharing, and coupon elements are located in subfolders within Configbeez.

Despite the differences in location, the subtemplate (.tpl) files always follow the naming convention of the Layout Style itself.

Using the “friendly” Layout Style within the “Winback Advanced” module as an example, the Layout Style template fileset consists of the following sub-template files:

- Body – located in mailhive/mailbeez/winback\_advanced/email/ **friendly**\_body\_html\_step1.tpl  
**friendly**\_body\_html\_step2.tpl  
**friendly**\_body\_html\_step3.tpl  
**friendly**\_body\_html\_step4.tpl
- Product List mailhive/configbeez/config\_list\_engine/templates/list\_**friendly**.tpl
- Social Sharing mailhive/configbeez/config\_social/templates/social\_**friendly**.tpl
- Coupons mailhive/configbeez/config\_coupon\_engine/templates/coupon\_**friendly**.tpl

The sub-templates for the product list, social sharing, and coupon elements are defined in the parent-template one step up in the hierarchy, (in this case the body sub-template), by html tags that can be changed when you create custom templates.

This flexibility allows you to mix these elements within the body templates. For example, maybe you like the “friendly” Layout Style the best for overall layout & design, but you prefer the styling of the product list element found in the “fashion” Layout Style. Simply replace the product list element in the “friendly” templates with the product list element from the “fashion” templates.

Each template “step” corresponds to an email cycle option in its module, (visible beneath the module name on the MailBeez Modules tab in your MailBeez interface). For example, mailhive/mailbeez/winback\_advanced/email/friendly\_body\_html\_**step1.tpl** corresponds to the **first** Winback email cycle option:

[![](http://localhost/wordpress_mailbeez_EOL/wp-content/themes/awake/lib/scripts/timthumb/thumb.php?src=http://www.mailbeez.com/images/doc/premium_email_tut/winback_email_cycles.png&w=270&h=59&zc=1&q=100 "Templates to Email Cycles Correspondance")](http://www.mailbeez.com/images/doc/premium_email_tut/winback_email_cycles.png "Templates to Email Cycles Correspondance")![](http://localhost/wordpress_mailbeez_EOL/wp-content/themes/awake/images/shortcodes/image_shadow.png)

Understanding this information now will help you later when you get started customizing templates.

## Creating Custom Templates

**Do not skip this step! Creating custom templates is a necessary step to avoid losing your customizations when you update your MailBeez framework and modules or when using the Template Manager module to switch between Theme or Layout Style templates!**

### Custom Theme Templates

**This process is only for those users who are NOT using the Template Manager or Multilanguage Extension with Template Manager modules. If you are using either of those modules, please skip down to the “Custom Theme Templates With Template Manager” section of this tutorial.**

Remembering that themes utilize the Common Main templates, just follow these few simple steps:

- In your Mailbeez fileset on your local drive, navigate to: /mailhive/common/templates/email\_html.tpl

[![](http://localhost/wordpress_mailbeez_EOL/wp-content/themes/awake/lib/scripts/timthumb/thumb.php?src=http://www.mailbeez.com/images/doc/premium_email_tut/common_main_template.png&w=270&h=92&zc=1&q=100 "Common Main Email Templates")](http://www.mailbeez.com/images/doc/premium_email_tut/common_main_template.png "Common Main Email Templates")![](http://localhost/wordpress_mailbeez_EOL/wp-content/themes/awake/images/shortcodes/image_shadow.png)

- Open the file in a text editor and then save it with a new name: perhaps email\_html\_**original**.tpl
- Repeat this process with the TXT template:  /mailhive/common/templates/email\_txt.tpl

[![](http://localhost/wordpress_mailbeez_EOL/wp-content/themes/awake/lib/scripts/timthumb/thumb.php?src=http://www.mailbeez.com/images/doc/premium_email_tut/common_main_template_backup.png&w=270&h=93&zc=1&q=100 "Custom Common Main Email Templates")](http://www.mailbeez.com/images/doc/premium_email_tut/common_main_template_backup.png "Custom Common Main Email Templates")![](http://localhost/wordpress_mailbeez_EOL/wp-content/themes/awake/images/shortcodes/image_shadow.png)

That’s it! You have just created your first set of Custom Theme templates by doing nothing more than creating back up copies of the original files! You may now safely edit your Custom Theme templates without worrying about data loss next time you upgrade MailBeez.

Just remember to keep a copy of both your original and customized files on your local drive.

What if you’ve already customized the original template files? No problem! Just follow the steps above using the files from your original download package or, if you no longer have it, download it again from [the download section](http://www.mailbeez.com/download/)

### Custom Theme Templates With Template Manager

**This process is only for those users who are using either the Template Manager or Multilanguage Extension with Template Manager modules.**

If you are using either the Template Manager or Multilanguage Extension with Template Manager modules, you have the ability to create as many Custom Theme templates as you wish!

Remembering that themes utilize the Common Main templates, just follow these few simple steps:

- In your Mailbeez fileset on your local drive, navigate to: /mailhive/common/templates/email\_html.tpl

[![](http://localhost/wordpress_mailbeez_EOL/wp-content/themes/awake/lib/scripts/timthumb/thumb.php?src=http://www.mailbeez.com/images/doc/configbeez/mailbeez_pro_tmplmngr/default_theme.png&w=270&h=90&zc=1&q=100 "Default Common Main Email Templates")](http://www.mailbeez.com/images/doc/configbeez/mailbeez_pro_tmplmngr/default_theme.png "Default Common Main Email Templates")![](http://localhost/wordpress_mailbeez_EOL/wp-content/themes/awake/images/shortcodes/image_shadow.png)

- Open the file in a text editor and then save it with a new name by adding the new name and an underscore before it, perhaps “mydefault\_” to get: mydefault\_email\_html.tpl
- Repeat this process with the TXT template:  /mailhive/common/templates/email\_txt.tpl

[![](http://localhost/wordpress_mailbeez_EOL/wp-content/themes/awake/lib/scripts/timthumb/thumb.php?src=http://www.mailbeez.com/images/doc/configbeez/mailbeez_pro_tmplmngr/mydefault_theme.png&w=270&h=89&zc=1&q=100 "Custom Default Common Main Email Templates")](http://www.mailbeez.com/images/doc/configbeez/mailbeez_pro_tmplmngr/mydefault_theme.png "Custom Default Common Main Email Templates")![](http://localhost/wordpress_mailbeez_EOL/wp-content/themes/awake/images/shortcodes/image_shadow.png)

- Upload the new custom Common Main templates to the appropriate directory on your server, in this case: /mailhive/common/templates/

That’s it! You have just created your first set of custom theme templates, which will now appear as **“mydefault”** in your list of available themes in the Template Manager and Multilanguage Extension configuration panels!

[![](http://localhost/wordpress_mailbeez_EOL/wp-content/themes/awake/lib/scripts/timthumb/thumb.php?src=http://www.mailbeez.com/images/doc/configbeez/mailbeez_pro_tmplmngr/theme_selector.png&w=175&h=107&zc=1&q=100 "Template Manager Configuration Setting - Theme Selector")](http://www.mailbeez.com/images/doc/configbeez/mailbeez_pro_tmplmngr/theme_selector.png "Template Manager Configuration Setting - Theme Selector")![](http://localhost/wordpress_mailbeez_EOL/wp-content/themes/awake/images/shortcodes/image_shadow.png)

If you are creating multilingual emails with the Multilanguage Extension with Template Manager module, there is no need to create Custom Theme templates for each language – the module will do it for you! See the “Editing Custom Theme Templates” section of the [Multilanguage Extension with Template Manager tutorial](http://www.mailbeez.com/documentation/tutorials/configbeez-tutorials/multilanguage-extension-with-template-manager-configuration-tutorial/)

What if you’ve already customized the existing template files? No problem! Just follow the steps above to save your customizations as a new set of custom theme template files.

### Custom Layout Style Body Templates

For this example, let’s say you’re working with the Winback Advanced module and that you really like the Friendly Layout Style of email templates. Just follow these steps to create a custom set of template files:

- In your Mailbeez fileset on your local drive, navigate to: mailhive/mailbeez/winback\_advanced/email/friendly\_body\_html\_step1.tpl

[![](http://localhost/wordpress_mailbeez_EOL/wp-content/themes/awake/lib/scripts/timthumb/thumb.php?src=http://www.mailbeez.com/images/doc/premium_email_tut/body_friendly.png&w=270&h=160&zc=1&q=100 "Friendly Layout Email Templates")](http://www.mailbeez.com/images/doc/premium_email_tut/body_friendly.png "Friendly Layout Email Templates")![](http://localhost/wordpress_mailbeez_EOL/wp-content/themes/awake/images/shortcodes/image_shadow.png)

- Open the file in a text editor and then save it with a new name by adding the new name before the Layout Style name, perhaps “my”, so you get: **my**friendly\_body\_html\_step1.tpl
- Repeat this process for the remaining “friendly” body sub-templates so you get: myfriendly\_body\_html\_step2.tpl  
 myfriendly\_body\_html\_step3.tpl  
 myfriendly\_body\_html\_step4.tpl

[![](http://localhost/wordpress_mailbeez_EOL/wp-content/themes/awake/lib/scripts/timthumb/thumb.php?src=http://www.mailbeez.com/images/doc/premium_email_tut/body_myfriendly.png&w=270&h=160&zc=1&q=100 "Custom Friendly Layout Email Templates")](http://www.mailbeez.com/images/doc/premium_email_tut/body_myfriendly.png "Custom Friendly Layout Email Templates")![](http://localhost/wordpress_mailbeez_EOL/wp-content/themes/awake/images/shortcodes/image_shadow.png)

- Upload the new custom Layout Style templates to the appropriate directory on your server, in this case: mailhive/mailbeez/winback\_advanced/email/

That’s it! You have just created your first set of custom layout templates, which will now appear as “**myfriendly**” in your list of available layouts in the Winback Advanced configuration panel!

[![](http://localhost/wordpress_mailbeez_EOL/wp-content/themes/awake/lib/scripts/timthumb/thumb.php?src=http://www.mailbeez.com/images/doc/configbeez/mailbeez_pro_tmplmngr/layout_style_selector.png&w=175&h=108&zc=1&q=100 "Winback Advanced Configuration Setting - Layout Style Selector")](http://www.mailbeez.com/images/doc/configbeez/mailbeez_pro_tmplmngr/layout_style_selector.png "Winback Advanced Configuration Setting - Layout Style Selector")![](http://localhost/wordpress_mailbeez_EOL/wp-content/themes/awake/images/shortcodes/image_shadow.png)

If you are creating multilingual emails with the Multilanguage Extension with Template Manager module, there is no need to create Custom Layout Style templates for each language – the module will do it for you! See the “Editing Custom Layout StylesTemplates” section of the [Multilanguage Extension with Template Manager](http://www.mailbeez.com/documentation/tutorials/configbeez-tutorials/multilanguage-extension-with-template-manager-configuration-tutorial/) tutorial.

What if you’ve already customized the existing template files? No problem! Just follow the steps above to save your customizations as a new set of custom layout style template files.

### Custom Layout Style Product List, Social Sharing, & Coupon Templates

**This process is only for those users creating single language sub-templates. If you are using the Multilanguage Extension with Template Manager module and are creating multilingual emails, please skip down to the “Custom Language Sub-Templates” section of this tutorial.**

You may recall from the section on “Understanding Layout Style Templates” that we mentioned html tags are used by parent templates to define which Layout Style’s product list, social sharing, and coupon template content will be inserted or merged into that template.

Since you will be creating custom sub-templates with new file names, you need to tell the body templates what the new names are so that it can incorporate the custom content when MailBeez builds the email.

Therefore, creating custom Layout Style product lists, social sharing, & coupon templates involve two separate steps:

- Create the custom sub- templates
- Edit the html tags in the custom Layout Style body templates you created earlier

Below are step-by-step instructions for each sub-template in its own section.

For continuity and ease of understanding, we will continue using the same “friendly” and custom “myfriendly” Layout Styles within the Winback Advanced module in our examples that we used in the “Custom Layout Style Body Templates” section.

#### Product List Sub-Templates

- In your Mailbeez fileset on your local drive, navigate to: mailhive/configbeez/config\_list\_engine/templates/list\_friendly.tpl

[![](http://localhost/wordpress_mailbeez_EOL/wp-content/themes/awake/lib/scripts/timthumb/thumb.php?src=http://www.mailbeez.com/images/doc/premium_email_tut/list_friendly.png&w=270&h=118&zc=1&q=100 "Friendly Layout Product List Templates")](http://www.mailbeez.com/images/doc/premium_email_tut/list_friendly.png "Friendly Layout Product List Templates")![](http://localhost/wordpress_mailbeez_EOL/wp-content/themes/awake/images/shortcodes/image_shadow.png)

- Open the file in a text editor and then save it with a new name by adding the new name before the Layout Style name, perhaps “my” so you get: list\_**my**friendly.tpl

[![](http://localhost/wordpress_mailbeez_EOL/wp-content/themes/awake/lib/scripts/timthumb/thumb.php?src=http://www.mailbeez.com/images/doc/premium_email_tut/list_myfriendly.png&w=270&h=120&zc=1&q=100 "Custom Friendly Layout Product List Templates")](http://www.mailbeez.com/images/doc/premium_email_tut/list_myfriendly.png "Custom Friendly Layout Product List Templates")![](http://localhost/wordpress_mailbeez_EOL/wp-content/themes/awake/images/shortcodes/image_shadow.png)

- Upload **list\_myfriendly.tpl** to the appropriate directory on your server, in this case: mailhive/configbeez/config\_list\_engine/templates/
- In your Mailbeez fileset on your local drive, navigate to your custom “myfriendly” Layout Style templates: mailhive/mailbeez/winback\_advanced/email/myfriendly\_body\_html\_step1.tpl

[![](http://localhost/wordpress_mailbeez_EOL/wp-content/themes/awake/lib/scripts/timthumb/thumb.php?src=http://www.mailbeez.com/images/doc/premium_email_tut/body_myfriendly.png&w=270&h=160&zc=1&q=100 "Custom Friendly Layout Email Templates")](http://www.mailbeez.com/images/doc/premium_email_tut/body_myfriendly.png "Custom Friendly Layout Email Templates")![](http://localhost/wordpress_mailbeez_EOL/wp-content/themes/awake/images/shortcodes/image_shadow.png)

- Open the file in a text editor and find this line of code: {$list\_engine.productlist\_friendly}
- Edit this code to follow the custom “myfriendly” Layout Style naming convention so you get this: {$list\_engine.productlist\_**my**friendly}
- Repeat this process for the remaining “myfriendly” body sub-templates: myfriendly\_body\_html\_step2.tpl  
 myfriendly\_body\_html\_step3.tpl  
 myfriendly\_body\_html\_step4.tpl
- Upload the “myfriendly” Layout Style body templates to the appropriate directory on your server, in this case: **mailhive/mailbeez/winback\_advanced/email/**myfriendly\_body\_html\_step1.tpl  
 myfriendly\_body\_html\_step2.tpl  
 myfriendly\_body\_html\_step3.tpl  
 myfriendly\_body\_html\_step4.tpl

- Upload **social\_myfriendly.tpl** to the appropriate directory on your server, in this case: mailhive/configbeez/config\_social/templates/
- Remembering that the social sub-template is nested within the product-list sub-template content in the template hierarchy, navigate to your custom “myfriendly” Layout Style templates in your Mailbeez fileset on your local drive: mailhive/configbeez/config\_list\_engine/templates/list\_myfriendly.tpl

[![](http://localhost/wordpress_mailbeez_EOL/wp-content/themes/awake/lib/scripts/timthumb/thumb.php?src=http://www.mailbeez.com/images/doc/premium_email_tut/list_myfriendly.png&w=270&h=120&zc=1&q=100 "Custom Friendly Layout Product List Templates")](http://www.mailbeez.com/images/doc/premium_email_tut/list_myfriendly.png "Custom Friendly Layout Product List Templates")![](http://localhost/wordpress_mailbeez_EOL/wp-content/themes/awake/images/shortcodes/image_shadow.png)

 myfriendly\_body\_html\_step3.tpl  
 myfriendly\_body\_html\_step4.tpl

That’s it! Your custom coupon sub-template is now ready for your customizations!

### Custom Language Sub-Templates

This section applies only to users of the Multilanguage Extension with Template Manager module.

If you’re using the Multilanguage Extension with Template Manager module to create emails in multiple languages, then you will also want to create custom sub-templates for each of the languages you’ll be using.

This can be accomplished by creating custom sub-templates in which the language variants are defined and then customizing the corresponding html tags in your custom Layout Style body templates.

Below are step-by-step instructions for each sub-template in its own section.

For continuity and ease of understanding, we will continue using the same “friendly” and custom “myfriendly” Layout Styles within the Winback Advanced module in our examples that we used in the “Custom Layout Style Body Templates” section.

#### Creating Custom Language Product List Sub-Templates

- In your Mailbeez fileset on your local drive, navigate to: mailhive/configbeez/config\_list\_engine/templates/list\_friendly.tpl

- Open the file in a text editor and then save it with a new name by adding the new name before the Layout Style name, perhaps “my” so you get: list\_**my**friendly.tpl

- Next, define the language you want to use by adding a language variant, “\_lang\_”, and a language-id, “1, 2, 3, etc”, to the name of the custom file you just created, like this: list\_myfriendly**\_lang\_1**.tpl
- Each language you use in your store has its own language-id. Since you need one sub-template ending in the appropriate language-id for each language you want to use, you will need to repeat this step for each language you have: list\_myfriendly**\_lang\_1**.tpl  
 list\_myfriendly**\_lang\_2**.tpl  
 list\_myfriendly**\_lang\_3**.tpl  
 etc..

## Backing Up Your Customizations

Once you have completed your customizations, it is crucial that you keep a copy of the customized template (.tpl) files on your local drive. Keeping a back up copy ensures you will be able to easily restore them if the need arises.

### Template Manager Users

If you are using either the Template Manager or Multilanguage Extension with Template Manager modules to customize your templates, the process for backing up your changes is more involved than just keeping a copy of the file on your hard drive. Please see the “Backing Up Your Customizations” section of the Template Manager tutorial for the module you are using:

- [Template Manager](http://www.mailbeez.com/documentation/tutorials/configbeez-tutorials/template-manager/)
- [Multilanguage Extension with Template Manager](http://www.mailbeez.com/documentation/tutorials/configbeez-tutorials/multilanguage-extension-with-template-manager-configuration-tutorial/)

## Popular Theme Customizations

**If you have not yet created custom templates, please do so before continuing with your customizations!**

If you’re using Template Manager or Multilanguage Extension with Template Manager, make your edits to your Custom Theme templates using the Template Editor in the Template Manager or Multilanguage Extension module

 

### Change the Email Header Image

Changing out the email header image is as easy as can be! Just follow these simple steps:

- Create a new image with a width of 600px
- Name the new image, for example “mynewheader.png”
- Using your preferred FTP program, upload the new image to: catalog/mailhive/common/images/
- Navigate to your custom Theme template: catalog/mailhive/common/templates/your\_custom\_template.tpl
- Find the line of code which defines the email header image: <img src=”**{$catalog\_server}mailhive/common/images/default\_emailheader.gif**” border=”0″ hspace=”0″ vspace=”0″ width=”600″>
- Edit the code shown above to reflect the new image name to get this: <img src=”**{$catalog\_server}mailhive/common/images/my\_new\_header.png**” border=”0″ hspace=”0″ vspace=”0″ width=”600″>

### Edit the Header and/or Footer

- Navigate to your custom Theme template: catalog/mailhive/common/templates/
- Change the header as desired by editing the content on lines 9-16 between the header tags
- Change the footer as desired by editing the content in the footer table that begins at line 60

### Capitalize the Customer Name

Sometimes customers use lower case when entering their information to create an account. If you want to make sure customer names are formatted properly, regardless of how the customer entered their data, you can apply this modifier by adding this:

|capitalize:true

To this:

{$firstname} {$lastname}

To get this:

{$firstname|capitalize:true} {$lastname|capitalize:true}

Which will generate capitalized output in emails:

Joe Smith

## Popular Layout Style Customizations

**If you have not yet created custom templates, please do so before continuing with your customizations!**

If you’re using Template Manager or Multilanguage Extension with Template Manager, make your edits to your Custom Layout Style templates using the Template Editor in each email module’s configuration panel

 

### Changing Text

It doesn’t get easier than this – simply replace the text you want to change with the text you want to use. Using the Nopurchase Advanced module as an example, let’s say you want to change the body text in your custom “myfriendly” Layout Style template:

- Navigate to the custom template in the Nopurchase Advance module that you want to edit: catalog/mailhive/mailbeez/nopurchase\_advanced/email/myfriendly\_body\_html\_step1.tpl
- Locate the block of text you want to change, for example: You recently created an account at {$storename}, and as you have yet to place an order, we would like to give you a discount voucher…
- Change it to something you prefer, for example: Thank you for creating an account with $storename. We’ve noticed that you haven’t yet placed an order with us. We’d love to help you get started by offering you a discount coupon….
- Repeat these steps using the text of your choice in the remaining body sub-templates for your custom Layout Style: myfriendly\_body\_html\_step2.tpl  
 myfriendly\_body\_html\_step3.tpl  
 myfriendly\_body\_html\_step4.tpl

### Changing Images

Changing out the email images are just as easy as changing the header image! Using the Review Advanced module as an example, let’s say you want to change the default chat bubble image in your custom “myfriendly” Layout Style template to an image of two people talking to each other. Just follow these simple steps:

- Create a new image, sized 254px by 180px
- Name the new image, for example “sharing.png”
- Using your preferred FTP program, upload the new image to your server: catalog/mailhive/mailbeez/review\_advanced/email/friendly
- Navigate to the Review Advanced custom email template: catalog/mailhive/mailbeez/review\_advanced/email/myfriendly\_body\_html\_step1.tpl
- Find the line of code which defines the Review Advanced default image: **{$modules\_root}review\_advanced/email/friendly/bubble.png”** width=”254″ height=”180″ style=”padding-right: 10px;
- Edit the code shown above to reflect the new image name to get this: **{$modules\_root}review\_advanced/email/friendly/sharing.png”** width=”254″ height=”180″ style=”padding-right: 10px;
- Repeat these steps in the remaining body sub-templates for your custom Layout Style: myfriendly\_body\_html\_step2.tpl  
 myfriendly\_body\_html\_step3.tpl  
 myfriendly\_body\_html\_step4.tpl

If you decide to use an image which is sized differently than the default image (254×180), then you will need to also edit the “width” and “height” parameters in the code above to match the new image size. Depending on how you size the image, you may also need to edit the “align” parameter and/or move the image to a new position within the layout.

### Change the Date Format

Variable modifiers allow you to adjust the output format of a date to your needs. For example, adding this:

|date\_format:”%A, %B %e, %Y”

To this:

{$date\_of\_birth}

Gives you this:

{$date\_of\_birth|date\_format:”%A, %B %e, %Y”}

Which will generate date output that looks like this:

Saturday, December 1, 1984

**[More Info on Date Related Modifications](http://www.smarty.net/docsv2/en/language.modifier.date.format.tpl)**

### Truncating a Long Product Name

If you want to shorten the length of a long product name, you can use a variable modifier to truncate it. As an example, let’s say that you want to truncate product names in your custom “myfriendly” Layout Style template within your Winback Advanced module. Follow these steps:

- Navigate to the appropriate custom template within the Winback Advanced module:  
 catalog/mailhive/configbeez/config\_list\_engine\_templates/list\_myfriendly.tpl
- Locate the block of code that contains the html tag for the product name:  
 {$products[product].name}
- Edit the block of code to add the variable modifier to get this:  
 {$products[product].name|truncate:40:”…”}

This customization will cut the product name after 40 characters and add **‘…’ ** behind it.

**[More information about language modifiers](http://www.smarty.net/docsv2/en/language.modifier.truncate.tpl)**

### Where Can I Customize the Product Grid?

Product grids are generated by the Mailbeez List Engine supplied with all Mailbeez Premium modules that use it. The layout of the product grid elements is defined in the product grid sub-templates.

Before you edit any product grid template file, you need to create a custom copy of the template file(s) you want to edit. Once you’ve done this, you must define the new custom product grid template in the body templates of the Layout Styles that will use it.

For more information, see the “Creating Custom Templates” section of this tutorial.

To edit your custom product grid templates, navigate to:

mailhive/configbeez/config\_list\_engine/templates/Name\_of\_Your\_Custom\_Template\_File.tpl

### Where Can I Customize the Social Sharing Block?

The social sharing blocks are generated by the Mailbeez Social Sharing Engine supplied with all Mailbeez Premium modules that use them. The layout of the social sharing elements is defined in the social sharing sub-templates.

Before you edit any social sharing template file, you need to create a custom copy of the template file(s) you want to edit. Once you’ve done this, you must define the new custom social sharing template in the body templates of the Layout Styles that will use it.

For more information, see the “Creating Custom Templates” section of this tutorial.

To edit your custom social sharing templates, navigate to:

mailhive/configbeez/config\_social/templates/Name\_of\_Your\_Custom\_Template\_File.tpl

### Where Can I Edit the Coupons?

The coupons are generated by the Mailbeez Coupon Engine supplied with all Mailbeez Premium Coupon modules. The layout of the coupon elements is defined in the coupon sub-templates.

Before you edit any coupon template file, you need to create a custom copy of the template file(s) you want to edit. Once you’ve done this, you must define the new custom coupon template in the body templates of the Layout Styles that will use it.

For more information, see the “Creating Custom Templates” section of this tutorial.

To edit your custom coupon templates, navigate to:

mailhive/configbeez/config\_coupon\_engine/templates/Name\_of\_Your\_Custom\_Template\_File.tpl

## Additional Tips for Zen Cart Users

### General Tips

- Make sure Zen Cart is configured to send email in HTML format. The Zen Cart tutorial for this is located here: http://tutorials.zen-cart.com/index.php?article=113
- For running simulations, make sure you have a test customer account set up in your Zen Cart and that it is configured to receive email in HTML format and that the configured email address for the test account is capable of rendering email in HTML format
- For sending test email, make sure you send one test to an account capable of rendering email in HTML format, and one test to an account that is configured to receive in TXT format. This way, you can see how both HTML and TXT formatted emails will appear to your customers.
- The best email services for rendering HTML based email are web-based email like gmail, hotmail, etc. Hosting account email services are generally configured to block HTML to protect the server.

### Using Zen Cart’s Template System

In MailBeez v2.6 and above, you can opt to use your Zen Cart email template system instead of using the MailBeez email template system. While it is recommended to use the MailBeez email template system due to ease of customization & use, you can certainly opt not to.

If you choose to use the Zen Cart email template system, or are running a MailBeez version prior to v2.6 which requires you to use the Zen Cart email template system, then an additional layer is added to the template hierarchy:

Zen Cart Default Email Template  
 This content is generated by Zen Cart’s email\_template\_default.html file and will apply to all emails Common Main Template/Theme Template  
 This content will apply to all emails generated by MailBeez Module specific Body Template/Layout Style Template  
 Content is merged into the Theme template content by the html code {$body} Product List sub-template\*  
 Content is merged into the body template content by the html code {$list\_engine.productlist} Social Sharing sub-template\*  
 Content is merged into the product list template content by the html code {$products[product].social}

 

Coupon sub-template\*  
 Content is merged into the body template content by the html code {$coupon.coupon}

 

 

 

*\*if used by the Module*

Looking at it this way, it is easy to see the impact your Zen Cart default email template has on the content generated by the MailBeez template system and why careful editing & extensive testing will be necessary. Zen Cart’s default email template is located here: (shop-root)/emails/email\_template\_default.html
