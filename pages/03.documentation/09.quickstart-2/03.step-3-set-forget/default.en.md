![](http://www.mailbeez.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/settings1.png "settings1")Now Mailbeez is installed, you should customize the supplied email templates to match your storeâ€™s branding and design. It is easy to adopt the basic email templates that are supplied with each MailBeez module, so you will be ready to go in no time at all.

After you have tested your MailBeez modules in Simulation mode and sent some test emails, you are ready for Production mode. Just click the Simulation button to change the status to Production, make sure you have set up a cron job on your server to activate Mailbeez every day, and the system will now take care of itself.
