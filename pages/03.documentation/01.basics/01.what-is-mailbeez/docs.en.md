MailBeez is a modular system for the implementation of fully automated after sale email campaigns. Typically installed within 5-15 minutes following some very easy steps, you can be sending out your first emails in no time! For further reading, take a look at the [Installation Manual](/documentation/installation/)

**Here are some examples of what Mailbeez can do:**

- Automate product review reminders
- Tempt back & reactivate old customers with personalised coupon offers
- Track and manage customer invoice payments with staggered payment reminder emails
- Email your customers on their Birthday, or even send Season Greetings, all with an embedded personalized coupon code
- Gather store reviews with the Mailbeez TrustPilot.com module
- Initiate customer satisfaction surveys after a defined number of days

Mailbeez sits within your store’s existing admin area in its own separate section. From the Mailbeez dashboard, you can track which emails have been sent, and see how your product review and winback emails are working out!


## Seamless integrated with your Store System

The tight, seamless integration of Mailbeez allows the system to access all available data and use these for meaningful actions and reports:

## Feature list

Whilst Mailbeez is a feature rich solution right out of the box, like any software, it is under constant development, with new features being added all the time. If you have the time, then please support us with feedback and suggestions.


**Easy adoption of your email templates**
