MailBeez has intentionally been designed with few requirements and you can easily install MailBeez into your Shop-System with a very small footprint. 

It maintains it's own tables and was developed not to interfer with other addons.

### Shop-System

MailBeez supports a range of store systems based on osCommerce and its forks like Zencart. Please visit
[MailBeez Installation](/documentation/installation) to see if your Store System is compatible with MailBeez.



### PHP Requirements

Very likely you already have a shop running on a Server with PHP5.2+ - thatâ€™s enough for MailBeez to work!



## Recommended Tools


### FTP Clients

To install MailBeez you need to have FTP access to transfer the new files to your Store-Server. The easiest way to accomplish this is with an [FTP Client](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol).  There are many available, but some recommended ones include:

1. [Transmit](http://panic.com/transmit/) - OS X - The de facto FTP/SFTP client on OS X.  Easy to use, fast, folder-syncing and pretty much anything else you could ask for.
2. [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) - OS X/Windows/Linux - Probably the best option for Windows and Linux users. Free and very powerful (but very ugly on the Mac!).
3. [Cyberduck](http://cyberduck.io/) - OS X/Windows - A decent free option for both OS X and Windows users.  Not as full featured as the others.
4. [ForkLift](http://www.binarynights.com/forklift/) - OS X - A solid alternative to Transmit, and slightly cheaper to boot.
