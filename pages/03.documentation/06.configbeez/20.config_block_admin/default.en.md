## About This Module

This module enhances the default Opt-Out handling which is already built into MailBeez by allowing you to adjust customer Opt-Out settings by manually editing which of your customers will receive Mailbeez generated emails. And it can all be done from within your store’s admin! With this module, you can:

- Insert “block all” links into your email templates, allowing customers to choose between blocking specific emails and blocking all MailBeez generated emails
- Manually unblock customers who opt-out via accidental click
- Disable opt-out for selected modules – for example, payment reminder emails
- Manually block and unblock a customer on a per module basis
- Manually block and unblock a customer on a global basis


##Features

The Advanced Opt-Out with admin covers following featres
>>>>>>the following code is already integrated in the latest responsive main templates


**Opt-Out all MailBeez Emails**

Introducing the template var `{$block_all_url}` allows you to add a new link to your email footer:

```html
<a href="{$block_url}">no more emails like this</a> | 
<a href="{$block_all_url}">no ore emails at all</a>
```

**Disable opt-out for selected modules**

for some modules, e.g. payment reminders you don't want to allow customers to block these emails. Using the following code these emails will not provide the opt-out links:
```
{if $noblock}
   You can not block this notification
{else}
   <a href="{$block_url}">no more emails like this</a> | 
   <a href="{$block_all_url}">no ore emails at all</a>
{/if}
```

## Opt-Out Administration

In some cases you might want to manually block - or unblock - a customer. The MailBeez Opt-Out Admin panel allows you to quickly find the customer and perform the necessary action:
