This module allows you to configure the integration with the apps.mailbeez.com Server - important to e.g. install and update Pro subscriptions.

You find your matching API-key on https://apps.mailbeez.com in section "Overview". Either navigate to "Subscriptions" or "Domains" and open the matching entry. Copy the API key and insert it here.

If you don't want to continue to use a subscription it is recommended to remove the API Key. In case you are having local certificate these will become active again.
