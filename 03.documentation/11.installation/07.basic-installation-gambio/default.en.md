The Installation of MailBeez is successfully tested with *Gambio GX Version* 1.10, running on PHP 5.2.11

The installation is straight forward and can be done in a couple of minutes by following these steps:

- copy new files
- add permission (half automatic)
- Install MailBeez

MailBeez is maintaining it’s own tables – the shops existing table stay as they are.

## Step 1 – copy new files

copy following file to your admin-directory

> mailbeez.php

copy following file and folder to your catalog-directory (where your index.php is located)

> mailhive (folder)
> 
> mailhive.php

## Step 2 – modify existing files

### 1. Add a menu entry

located and open the file

> admin/includes/column\_left.php

find

> ' . BOX_IMPORT . '</a><br>';

add

> if (($_SESSION['customers_status']
>     ['customers_status_id'] == '0') && ($admin_access['module_newsletter'] == '1')) echo '<li class="leftmenu_body_item"><a class="fav_drag_item" href="' . xtc_href_link('mailbeez.php') . '"> MailBeez</a></li>';

this will add the menu-entry “MailBeez” to your Tools-Box. Feel free to place this link whereever you want.

## Step 3 – add permission

run

(shop)/mailhive.php

this will add the required permission for MailBeez for the primary admin account.

If necessary add admin permission for MailBeez for secondary admin accounts as well
