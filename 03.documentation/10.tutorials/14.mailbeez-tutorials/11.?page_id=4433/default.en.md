The screenshots used in this tutorial were made using Zen Cart. If you use a different e-commerce platform, your admin interface and MailBeez interface may appear slightly different, however the concepts and configuration instructions are the same across all platforms.

## Configuring the Share Review Module

There are 5 function buttons and 6 configurable settings. We will go through each of them one at a time.

### General Settings

Click the “Edit” button to access the configurable settings:

[![](http://localhost/wordpress_mailbeez_EOL/wp-content/themes/awake/lib/scripts/timthumb/thumb.php?src=http://www.mailbeez.com/images/doc/mailbeez/review_facebook/reviewFB_config3.png&w=175&h=288&zc=1&q=100 "Share Review on Facebook General Settings")](http://www.mailbeez.com/images/doc/mailbeez/review_facebook/reviewFB_config3.png "Share Review on Facebook General Settings")![](http://localhost/wordpress_mailbeez_EOL/wp-content/themes/awake/images/shortcodes/image_shadow.png)

**Activate Module**  
 This setting turns the module on and off. It is set to “False” by default, meaning the module is off and will not send emails to customers. Change this setting to “True” to activate the module and enable it to send emails when the module is run.

**Target Days After Review & Target Days to Look Back**  
In earlier versions of this module, these settings are “set days passed” and “set days to skip after”. The concept is the same, but the language has been updated for ease of use.

These settings work together to create a window of time in which MailBeez will look for opportunities to send the Share Review on Facebook email by targeting customers who fall within the time frame you create with these settings.

**Target Days After Review**  
 This setting lets you choose how many days after the review was written to send an email to the customer inviting them to share the review on Facebook. By default it it set to 1, meaning that an email will be sent to the customer the day after they write their review. If you want MailBeez to wait a little longer before sending out the email, simply increase this number.

**Target Days to Look Back**  
 This setting lets you define how far back in time MailBeez should look for customers who meet the ‘Days After Review criteria’. By default, it is set to 4 and must always be a higher number than the “Target Days After Review” setting.

Keep this number low. If you put a really high number here, then the review-share opportunities MailBeez finds will not be recent.

The default settings of 1 Day After Review and 4 Days to Look Back work together to tell MailBeez “When this module is run, search my database for the last 4 days and find all customers who wrote a review in the last 1 to 4 days and send them an email inviting them to share their review on Facebook.”

MailBeez will disregard customers who meet the criteria of these two settings who have already received a Share Review on Facebook email, ensuring that a customer will not receive the same email twice.

**Sender Email**  
 This setting lets you control the email address that is displayed as the sender in your outgoing MailBeez emails. By default, it uses the email address setting that you configured in your store, but you can change it if you prefer.

**Sender Name**  
 This setting lets you control the sender name that is displayed as the sender in your outgoing MailBeez emails. By default, it uses the sender name setting that you configured in your store, but you can change it if you prefer.

**Sort Order of Display**  
 This setting allows you to change the sort order of this module to move it higher or lower on the list of modules in the MailBeez Modules tab.

When you have completed your configurations, click the “Update button”. Configuration of the module is now complete!  
  

### Test & Run the Share Review Module

The 5 function buttons are the controls that allow you to test the module and then manually run it when you’re ready:

[![](http://localhost/wordpress_mailbeez_EOL/wp-content/themes/awake/lib/scripts/timthumb/thumb.php?src=http://mailbeez.com/images/doc/common_images/function_buttons.png&w=175&h=184&zc=1&q=100 "Function Buttons")](http://mailbeez.com/images/doc/common_images/function_buttons.png "Function Buttons")![](http://localhost/wordpress_mailbeez_EOL/wp-content/themes/awake/images/shortcodes/image_shadow.png)

**Email Templates – “HTML” Button**  
 This button allows you to preview the module templates in a nice popup window in HTML format. This way, you can easily see what the email template looks like and quickly determine which aspects of the template you’ll want to customize for your use.

As you modify your template files, you can come back and use this button to view your changes to ensure that they are appearing as you intend.

**When you’re ready to customize your email templates, have a look at our [Customizing Free Email Templates tutorial](http://www.mailbeez.com/documentation/tutorials/customizing-mailbeez-free-email-templates/)**

**Email Templates – “TXT” Button**  
 This button allows you to preview the module templates in a nice popup window in text format. Everyone has customers who prefer to receive email in text format. This tool allows you to see what they see, and preview changes you make to the template before they go out to your customers.

**Recipients – “Show” Button**  
 Clicking this button will result in a nice popup window in your admin which is populated with a list of everyone who is getting this email in the next run. (Depending on the “early check” setting you will see all or new recipients only)

**Send Test Email – “Send” Button**  
 This button does just what it says – it lets you send a test email with test data.

**Run this module – “Run” Button**  
 This is the button you use to actually run the module. This button respects your run mode as it is set in your Simulation Configuration, so if you’re in Simulation Mode, clicking this button results in a simulation run. If you are in Production Mode, clicking this button results in a production run.

It even tells you in the text above the button which mode you’re in. This prevents you from accidentally sending emails out to customers when you’re testing.



## Run MailBeez Automatically

If you want MailBeez to run automatically, you have two options:

**1. [Set up a cronjob](http://www.mailbeez.com/documentation/installation/config/advanced-configuration/)
2. [Install the simple and affordable Run MailBeez Automatically module](http://www.mailbeez.com/documentation/configbeez/config_cron_simple/)
**
Without one of the above options in place, it will be up to you to manually send out your MailBeez emails by clicking the “Run” button in each module you want to run, as often as you want to run it. The Run MailBeez Automatically module is recommended because it is for most users the easiest option.

## Template Manager

Mailbeez has developed a handy module that easily allows you to both edit and view your text changes right from the MailBeez interface within your store’s admin. Fully functional with all official MailBeez Modules (free, premium, and custom built), the MailBeez Template Manager makes editing a template a breeze, so much so that you may wonder how you ever lived without it! **[ Learn more!](http://www.mailbeez.com/documentation/configbeez/config_tmplmngr/)**
