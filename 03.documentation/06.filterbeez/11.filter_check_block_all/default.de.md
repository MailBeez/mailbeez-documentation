## Ensure Opted-Out Customers Donâ€™t Get Email

Delivered with the [Advanced Opt-Out with Admin](http://www.mailbeez.com/documentation/configbeez/config_block_admin/) module, this filter checks for customers who have elected to opt-out of all MailBeez generated emails before sending out emails when an email module is run.

**Note:** This filter will not block payment collection emails from being sent out to customers who owe you money, even if these customers have opted out of receiving all MailBeez generated emails.

Payment collection emails are generated by the Payment Dunning modules [Payment Invoice Dunning](http://www.mailbeez.com/documentation/mailbeez/payment_invoice_dunning/) and [Payment in Advance Dunning](http://www.mailbeez.com/documentation/mailbeez/payment_inadvance_dunning/)
